Once there was a SUB_adjective_SUB boy named Mike.
He had a very SUB_adjective_SUB SUB_bodypart_SUB.
So because of this he decided to go to the airport one day.
Looking at the planes in the airport, Mike thought to himself that they look like SUB_pluralnoun_SUB.
Mike SUB_adverb_SUB to the airport, and decided to grab a snack on the way.  "I know,"
he thought.  "I'll stop at my favorite SUB_ANIMAL_SUB meat shop!"
On the way to the shop, Mike ran across his old friend Vanessa. Vanessa was acting very strange, imitating a SUB_noun_SUB.
Since this behavior was troubling to Mike, he decided to SUB_VERB_SUB the nearest SUB_NOUN_SUB and SUB_NOUN_SUB and feed it to Vanessa, since he had read that this combination of things has medicinal qualities.  That didn't seem to do the trick,
because now Vanessa was acting SUB_ADVERB_SUB liike a SUB_NOUN_SUB.   SUB_EXCLAMATION_SUB Mike said.  "Oh well, I'll just
throw her in this old SUB_LARGEOBJECT_SUB and hope that SUB_RAVENOUSANIMAL_SUB doesn't eat her.  And with that, he
continued on his trip to the airport.  Oh Happy Day!
