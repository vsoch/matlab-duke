Many years ago, there was quite an uproad in the small town of SUB_TOWNNAME_SUB.  You see, a famous person named
SUB_YOURNAME_SUB had just moved to the area, who was the famous inventor of SUB_ADJECTIVE_SUB SUB_NOUN_SUB.  Although
the townsfolk were excited, they couldn't help but notice this new resident SUB_VERB_ENDING_IN_ING_SUB SUB_PLURALANIMAL_SUB
from his porch.  One resident, SUB_FUNNYNAME_SUB , even reported that he saw the new neighbor SUB_ADVERB_SUB SUB_VERB_ENDING_IN_ING_SUB his pet SUB_NOUN_SUB with SUB_NOUN_SUB.  It took SUB_NUMBER_OF_DAYS_SUB for the resident to
clear the image of the SUB_ADVERB_SUB act from his mind.  The new resident did, however, come with perks.  He must have
been magical, because everyone saw a heightened increase in the size of their SUB_PLURALBODYPART_SUB, and the speed at
which they completed the chore of SUB_HOUSEHOLD_CHORE_SUB doubled.  It was only Poor Old Mrs. SUB_NAME_SUB that suffered.
When she used a SUB_NOUN_SUB and a SUB_NOUN_SUB to SUB_VERB_SUB her SUB_PET_SUB, the consequences were horrific.  SUB_EXCLAMATION_SUB ! she cried... how will my poor pet ever SUB_ADVERB_SUB SUB_VERB_SUB the SUB_OBJECTOUTSIDE_SUB now! 
Little did she know, the new resident had already fixed the problem, and bought her a SUB_RAVENOUSANIMAL_SUB to eat her
pet.  That is the end of the story!
