Reading pedigree information from [ 999.tfam ] 
1 individuals read from [ 999.tfam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 1 missing
0 males, 1 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
966977 (of 966977) markers to be included from [ 999.tped ]
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 966977 SNPs
0 founders and 1 non-founders found
963494 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ 999.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is nan
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 966977 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 1 missing
