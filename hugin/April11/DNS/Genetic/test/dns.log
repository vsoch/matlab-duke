Merging 2 samples, final sample contains 2 individuals and 966977 markers
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 966977 SNPs
0 founders and 2 non-founders found
963494 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ dns.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is nan
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 966977 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 2 missing
