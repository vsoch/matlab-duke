# This script is intended to create a region of interest using the ROI tools

# ---------WHEN DO I RUN THIS?------------
# 
#

# --------WHAT DO I NEED TO CHANGE?------------
# the email to direct the successful run of the script
# 

#------------SUBMISSION ON COMMAND LINE---------------

# [vvs4@head ~]$ qsub -v EXPERIMENT=Dummy.01 create_roi.sh
# There are 2 USER sections 
#  1. USER DIRECTIVE: If you want mail notifications when
#     your job is completed or fails you need to set the 
#     correct email address.
#		   
#  2. USER SCRIPT: Add the user script in this section.
#     Within this section you can access your experiment 
#     folder using $EXPERIMENT. All paths are relative to this variable
#     eg: $EXPERIMENT/Data $EXPERIMENT/Analysis	
#     By default all terminal output is routed to the " Analysis "
#     folder under the Experiment directory i.e. $EXPERIMENT/Analysis
#     To change this path, set the OUTDIR variable in this section
#     to another location under your experiment folder
#     eg: OUTDIR=$EXPERIMENT/Analysis/GridOut 	
#     By default on successful completion the job will return 0
#     If you need to set another return code, set the RETURNCODE
#     variable in this section. To avoid conflict with system return 
#     codes, set a RETURNCODE higher than 100.
#     eg: RETURNCODE=110
#     Arguments to the USER SCRIPT are accessible in the usual fashion
#     eg:  $1 $2 $3
# The remaining sections are setup related and don't require
# modifications for most scripts. They are critical for access
# to your data
