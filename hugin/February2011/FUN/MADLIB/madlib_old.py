There are some obvious things, such as being familiar with PHP and WordPress theme code (and the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development_Checklist">theme development checklist</a>), with an eye for security issues. You would also need to have the ability to set up a separate install of the latest version of WordPress for testing theme submissions.</p>\n<p>Hopefully a few talented theme developers are reading this right now and saying to themselves, &#8220;I’d love to help!

Since that first WordCamp in 2006, back when WordPress was on version 2.0 (Duke), the number of people using WordPress to power their web publishing &#8212; from personal blogs to large-scale commercial sites &#8212; has grown by millions. It&#8217;s no wonder this year&#8217;s event is going to be so great.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with <a href="http://wordcamp.org/">WordCamps</a>, here&#8217;s the skinny: the San Francisco event is the flagship, put together each year under the direction of WordPress co-founder and lead developer <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a>, who traditionally reports on the &#8220;State of the Word&#8221; and assembles a lineup of <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/speakers/">speakers</a> that have inspired him over the past year. This year&#8217;s lineup includes luminaries such as Richard Stallman, the father of Free Software, best-selling author Scott Berkun, and Salon.com co-founder Scott Rosenberg. As the final speaker list is finalized, the remaining speakers will be added to the <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp SF website</a>, but a surprise or two is still possible.</p>\n<p>Though the main event is on Saturday, May 1, there are additional <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/schedule/">days of WordPress goodness</a> in store. Saturday, May 1 will be the main conference with scheduled speakers. There will be keynotes, session tracks for both bloggers/end-users and developers, and lightning talks to provide a broad mix of content, followed by a raging afterparty. Sunday, May 2 will shift location and tone, with a low-key developers&#8217; unconference for the super-code-focused attendees. May 3 and 4 are conference-free, but a WordPress core contributor in-person code sprint will span those two days, bringing together core contributors old and new from around the globe for two days of intense hacking (and let&#8217;s face it, 3.0 bug fixes).</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in the Bay Area, or can be, and want to attend <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/tickets/">go get your ticket today</a>!</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">*     *      *      *     *</p>\n<h3><strong>Other Upcoming WordCamps</strong></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely WordCamp season; just check out the growing list of upcoming WordCamps over the next couple of months!

If you get stuck, need collaborators, or have a question about the best way to approach a fix, hop into the dev channel on IRC at irc.freenode.net, channel #wordpress-dev. Core developers will be around over the weekend working on bugs themselves, so if you&#8217;re trying to help, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions. With your help, maybe by Monday we can knock the bug count down to half of what it is right now. How great would that be? (Answer: pretty great)</p>\n<p>The sprint will go full force until Monday afternoon, when the lead developers and core committers will all stop to take a breath and look at the remaining bug reports to see how we did over the weekend, so don&#8217;t wait!

This means there are a few things we&#8217;re still finishing. We wanted to get people testing it this weekend, so we&#8217;re releasing it now rather than waiting another week until everything is finalized and polished. There&#8217;s a ton of stuff going on in 3.0, so this time we&#8217;re giving you a list of things to check out, so that we can make sure people are testing all the things that need it.</p>\n<p><span id="more-1303"></span>You Should Know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The custom menus system (Appearance &gt; Menus) is not quite finished. In Beta 2, the layout will be different and a bunch of the functionality will be improved, but we didn&#8217;t want to hold things up for this one screen. You can play with making custom menus, and report bugs if you find them, but this is not how the final screen will look/work, so don&#8217;t get attached to it.</li>\n<li>The merge! Yes, WordPress and WordPress MU have merged. This does not mean that you can suddenly start adding a bunch of new blogs from within your regular WordPress Dashboard. If you&#8217;re interested in testing the Super Admin stuff associated with multiple sites, you&#8217;ll need <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Andrea/Create_A_Network">some simple directions</a> to get started.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;re still fiddling with a few small things in the UI, as we were focused on getting the more function-oriented code finished first. For example, we&#8217;re getting a new icon for the Super Admin section.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things to test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Play with the new default theme, Twenty Ten, including the custom background and header options.</li>\n<li>Custom Post Type functionality has been beefed up. It&#8217;s <a href="http://kovshenin.com/archives/custom-post-types-in-wordpress-3-0/">really easy</a> to add new types, so do that and see how it looks!</li>\n<li>WordPress MU users should test the multiple sites functionality to make sure nothing broke during the merge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Already have a test install that you want to switch over to the beta?

When all those apps started popping up using the Twitter API, things like automatically following anyone who followed you and sending an automatic Direct Message seemed like good ideas. We&#8217;re all friends, right? Wrong. That auto-follow bit us hard, and the huge amount of spam the account gets means that it&#8217;s been nearly impossible to monitor legitimate messages from WordPress users and developers who need to be pointed to a help resource. We&#8217;re sorry! Just as we needed to get the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">Ideas Forum</a> under control* so that it could become a more useful resource for the community, we needed to get rid of the spam clogging our Twitter arteries. Except there was no easy way to do it.</p>\n<p>We had wound up following over 50,000 people. If someone went to the @WordPress profile page on Twitter to see the stream of updates from people we followed, almost none of it had anything to do with WordPress or the community. Diet pills, Twitter scams, and multi-posted spam messages were the norm. Yuck! Who else wishes there was <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> for Twitter? Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no easy way to clear this stuff out quickly (mass unfollows trigger their TOS alert, so it&#8217;s not surprising). I even contacted Twitter directly to see what the options might be, and it was suggested we use a script to clear the account.<strong> To be clear: </strong>Twitter flagged our account so that when the script was run they wouldn&#8217;t mark us as spammers for violating the TOS with a mass unfollow. We communicated with them beforehand, and the use of scripts to do this is not encouraged. Twitter was doing us a nice favor to help us get our house in order. Thanks, Twitter! Last night I ran the script and removed everyone. Extreme, but in good cause, right?</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re now starting to re-follow real people from the WordPress community. There will be no more auto-follow. If you are a WordPress developer, designer, blogger, fan site, whatever &#8212; and think your tweets should appear in the @WordPress updates stream, then send an @ reply to us and we can add you to the new list (assuming you&#8217;re not hawking diet pills, free iPads or ways to get a million followers). This way, people who are new to WordPress and go to check us out on Twitter will (hopefully) get a sense of the vibrant community that we have. People who send @ messages to us won&#8217;t (hopefully) wonder indefinitely why they were ignored, because without all the spam, maybe we can use Twitter as it was intended to be used, as another channel of communication.</p>\n<p>And for anyone who uses Qwitter and thinks @WordPress stopped loving them because of the last tweet they posted before the script ran&#8230; sorry! It wasn&#8217;t like that, we swear! It would be nice if the script could have done a bulk DM before the removal, but nope (otherwise we&#8217;d have included a message about this). So trust us, we still like you! And if you haven&#8217;t already been re-followed, please don&#8217;t take it personally&#8230; just send an @reply to @WordPress (tell us how you use WordPress!) and we&#8217;ll try to get you re-added soon. Later today (hopefully) you&#8217;ll find out what&#8217;s been keeping us so busy!</p>\n<p><em>*Have you noticed?

I was a kid my dad used to practice his typing skills (on a real typewriter no less) with the phrase:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For some reason that has stuck with me all these years. Today I’m going to rephrase and re-purpose that line:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now is the time for great theme developers to come to the aid of their community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The theme directory has been chugging along for more than a year now. During that time we’ve tinkered with the review process and some of the management tools, but haven’t really opened it up as much as we’d like. It&#8217;s time to rip off the band-aid and take some action; to that end, we&#8217;re looking for community members to help with the process of reviewing themes for the directory.</p>\n<p>Right now this is a bit like a New Year’s resolution to exercise every day: it’s what we need to do, but we’re still figuring out exactly how it will all work. That’s part of the community involvement as well &#8212; we expect that those who pitch in will also help shape the process.</p>\n<p>What’s involved in reviewing themes for the directory? There are some obvious things, such as being familiar with PHP and WordPress theme code (and the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development_Checklist">theme development checklist</a>), with an eye for security issues. You would also need to have the ability to set up a separate install of the latest version of WordPress for testing theme submissions.</p>\n<p>Hopefully a few talented theme developers are reading this right now and saying to themselves, &#8220;I’d love to help! How do I to get started?&#8221; Just join the new <a href="http://lists.wordpress.org/mailman/listinfo/theme-reviewers">theme reviewers mailing list</a> and we&#8217;ll get you up to speed on this new opportunity to come to the aid of your community.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Jun 2010 16:06:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Joseph Scott";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: Automated Snail Mail";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=34715";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://ma.tt/2010/06/automated-snail-mail/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:358:"<p>Been looking into ways to send personalized letters and postcards through the mail system, old school style.

If you aren&#8217;t familiar with StackOverflow or any of its sister-sites, it&#8217;s a sort of Questions and Answers forum where good answers are voted up, and float to the top. There is also a reputation system which rewards users for being active and providing quality feedback. I was not previously an active member on any of the sites, but I had run across answers to some of my own questions in the past when using Google to search.</p>\n<p>I signed up on the WordPress Answers site, which is currently in a &#8216;discussion&#8217; phase, where it needs sample questions to help define the scope. I provided some questions of my own, voted on the &#8216;on-topic&#8217; or &#8216;off-topic&#8217; status for the sample questions, and provided feedback on many questions when I thought it was necessary to explain my opinion.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back on the wp-hackers mailing list, there was a flurry of responses, including some people concerned that catering to this additional site might &#8220;splinter the development community&#8221; between the <em>official</em> and <em>unofficial</em> sites.</p>\n<p><span id="more-2273"></span>When I first started looking at the StackExchange site, I mentioned it to <a href="http://www.digitaldivas.net/">my wife, Susan</a>. She likes WordPress, but she uses <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> a lot at work. After noticing that nobody else had set up a Drupal proposal yet, she started <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/2978/drupal-answers">Drupal Answers</a>. Shortly after, someone asked why such a site would be needed, when there are already Drupal forums, and asked, &#8220;Is it good to splinter that effort?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again with the &#8220;splintering&#8221; talk? Why does this particular project invite claims of dividing the community? I know that in the WordPress community, there are many other places besides the official support forums where users gather to ask questions and share information &#8211;<a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/news/"> Weblog Tools Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/forum/">WP Tavern</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wordpress">StackOverflow</a> just to name a few, and many plugins and themes have their own support venues, hosted by their creators. And I&#8217;m sure the same is true in the Drupal world. Why are these different, why no cries of &#8220;splintering the community&#8221; over these?</p>\n<p>So, what do you think? Is there really a problem with a support site for questions and answers, separate from the &#8220;official&#8221; support forums? What features make you want to use one over the other, or both? What is <em>your</em> favorite place to find answers?</p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2010/02/23/dougal-on-wordpress-community-podcast" rel="bookmark"

morning everyone and welcome to the latest edition of WordPress Theme Releases. I hope all of you are enjoying the weekend. I know I am. So, grab a cup of coffee and have a look at the latest offerings from the WordPress community.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://www.polaraul.com/2010/06/folio-theme/" title="Folio: www.polaraul.com">Folio</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Folio.png" alt="" title="Folio" width="200" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8149" /></p>\n<p>Folio is a dark theme aimed at those wanting to create a showcase-type of site such as one that features wallpapers, backgrounds etc. It automatically creates custom fields for preview, image, download and more information links. Supports the WP-PostRatings plugin. This is a child theme of Aurelia which of course means Aurelia must be present in your theme folder for Folio to work. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/aurelia" title="Aurelia: wordpress.org">Aurelia</a> can be found in the WordPress Theme Repository.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://www.diaboliquedesign.com/diaboliquespring/" title="Diabolique Spring: www.diaboliquedesign.com">Diabolique Spring</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/diabolique-spring.png" alt="" title="diabolique-spring" width="200" height="167" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8150" /></p>\n<p>Diabolique Spring is the second theme of Diabolique Design we have featured. This is a sharp-looking dark theme which comes packed with 4 different background images as well as 3 types of backgrounds for your headlines. Some of this theme&#8217;s features include a large footer, cool looking social bookmarking icons and drop-shadow effect for both the sidebar and post area boxes.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://teaser.vibefolio.com/" title="Vibefolio teaser: teaser.vibefolio.com">Vibefolio teaser</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/vibefolio_teaser.png" alt="" title="vibefolio_teaser" width="200" height="147" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8151" /></p>\n<p>Vibefolio teaser is a clean-looking theme which sports a horizontal navigation menu for pages, a widgetized right sidebar and a widgetized 5-column footer. From the theme&#8217;s option page you can do all sorts of things such as upload a custom logo and favicon, include links to Feedburner, Flickr, Twitter and Facebook, insert your Google Analytics code and even disable excerpts. Comes with the TimThumb script.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://www.politicalcampaignwordpresstheme.com/" title="Political Campaign WordPress Theme: www.politicalcampaignwordpresstheme.com">Political Campaign WordPress Theme</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Political-Campaign.png" alt="" title="Political-Campaign" width="200" height="154" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8152" /></p>\n<p>This is a crisp and clean-looking theme perfect for, you guessed it, sites dedicated to political campaigning. For that matter it can be used on any type of political site. It sports a horizontal navigation menu for displaying pages and a widgetized 2 column footer.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://www.dynamicwp.net/free-themes/fun-day-theme/" title="FunDay: www.dynamicwp.net">FunDay</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/FunDay.png" alt="" title="FunDay" width="200" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8153" /></p>\n<p>DynamicWP has been on a tear releasing new themes regularly since arriving on the scene. Their latest release FunDay is a bit of a departure from their previous work as it has a lighthearted feel to it. It has 2 horizontal navigation menus, one for displaying pages and the other for categories, a widgetized right sidebar and built-in Flickr and Twitter streams. From the theme&#8217;s options page you can upload a new logo and Gravatar, exclude pages and categories from the nav menus and include links to Twitter, your RSS feed and RSS email among other things.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/wedding-bells" title="Wedding Bells: wordpress.org">Wedding Bells</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wedding-bells.png" alt="" title="wedding-bells" width="200" height="157" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8154" /></p>\n<p>Wedding Bells is a crisp, clean and neat looking theme released by Finnish designer Lauri Liimatta. It sports a horizontal navigation menu for pages and a widgetized right sidebar as well as a large header image which can be changed from the backend.</p>\n<p>We hope you have enjoyed this latest round of theme releases. As usual, if you have any comments, questions or suggestions feel free to drop them in the comments section below. We value your feedback.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 06 Jun 2010 08:34:07

3.0 is almost out the door and one of the most exciting developments regarding the new version is the menu management system. This system started as a major contribution from WooThemes with their WooNav code but since it&#8217;s integration, the WooNav code has been reworked practically line for line to the point where there is almost nothing left of the original. At the time, WooThemes was heralded as an awesome company for contributing such a great piece of functionality to the core of WordPress. I still believe it&#8217;s great they contributed WooNav to the menu system but now things get dicey when it comes to how much credit should be given to WooThemes.</p>\n<p>There have been a <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/woothemes-has-and-will-continue-to-get-credit" target="_blank">few posts discussing</a> the credit factor and WooThemes concerning the new menu system. Some people think WooThemes deserves more credit while others think that credit has been given where credit was due. Not only did WooThemes get a lot of press when they made the announcement of giving WooNav to the WordPress core team, but I imagine they will be among the list of all of the other contributors receiving props once WordPress 3.0 goes live. </p>\n<p>One thing I have not noticed since my foray into the WordPress community is individuals claiming &#8220;<i>I did this</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>I did that</i>&#8221; as if it put them on a higher place than everyone else. Most contributors have been just fine with props given in the major release posts. Again, I don&#8217;t think credit is the main motivator for contributors, it&#8217;s just the icing on the cake. I could be wrong though which I hope you&#8217;ll tell me in the comments.</p>\n<p>I have a few questions I want to ask to the wider community. For starters, is everyone that contributes to WordPress on a level playing field in terms of making the software better, or are certain people better than everyone else? Secondly, what do you consider to be adequate credit given to contributors. Third, if you have previous experience, why do you contribute to the WordPress project? Is it for personal gain or just to make the software better? </p>\n<p>The last question I have, do you think the WordPress project would get along just fine if the entire notion of giving props or any credit disappeared. That way, it&#8217;s all about the software, not about the people and their egos.

So how do you use it?</p>\n<p>This tutorial assumes your are comfortable using FTP clients such as <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a> and doing basic edits of WordPress files.</p>\n<p>1. Download WordPress 3.0 release candidate. You can find it <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2010/05/wordpress-3-0-release-candidate/">here</a>.</p>\n<p>2. Edit wp-config in your favorite text editor and add the following line:</p>\n<p>define(&#8216;WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE&#8217;, true);</p>\n<p>(I&#8217;d suggest adding it just above the line &#8220;// ** MySQL settings &#8211; You can get this info from your web host ** //&#8221;)</p>\n<p>3. Install WordPress normally</p>\n<p>NOTE: If you&#8217;ve already installed WordPress 3.0, just edit wp-config and add that line of code, there&#8217;s no need to re-install.</p>\n<p>4. Under Tools on the sidebar, you&#8217;ll now have an &#8220;Network&#8221; option. Click it.</p>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/screenshot-0.jpg" alt="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" title="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" width="144" height="118" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8139" /></p>\n<p>5. Here you&#8217;ll setup your &#8220;Network&#8221; &#8211; a Network is all the blogs or sites you&#8217;ll have under your WordPress install (if you&#8217;re migrating back to WordPress from WordPress Multiuser this might be confusing. In WordPress Multiuser the term for network was &#8220;site&#8221; and the term for site was &#8220;blog.&#8221; Explanation <a href="http://www.andrewnacin.com/2010/03/25/terminology-nightmare-blogs-sites-networks/">here</a>).</p>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/screenshot-1.jpg" alt="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" title="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" width="611" height="226" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8140" /></p>\n<p>If your host supports it, you&#8217;ll have the option here to choose between subdomains and subdirectories.</p>\n<p>Example of a subdomain: site1.yourdomain.com<br />\nExample of a subdirectory: yourdomain.com/site1</p>\n<p>Fill out your Network Title and Admin E-mail Address and press install.</p>\n<p>6. You&#8217;ll be greeted with your next list of steps: creating a blogs.dir directory, editing wp-config.php, and .htaccess. WP recommends, as do I, backing up wp-config.php and .htaccess files before proceeding.</p>\n<p>After completing the steps, you&#8217;ll need to log back into WordPress.</p>\n<p>7. On your next login, you&#8217;ll notice a new menu: &#8220;Super Admin.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/screenshot-2.jpg" alt="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" title="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" width="149" height="168" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8141" /></p>\n<p>8. Click &#8220;Sites&#8221; under this option to create a new site. Fill out the forms accordingly.</p>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/screenshot-3.jpg" alt="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" title="WordPress 3.0 Multisite Screenshot" width="414" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8142" /></p>\n<p>9. After creating a new site, click Users. You&#8217;ll see a new user was created for the new site.</p>\n<p>10. You can control all sites on your network through the Super Admin menu, but for right now you might find it easier to administer individual sites through their own admin menus. You can access them as you would a normal wordpress site.

Now that you&#8217;ve had a chance to update your information and make sure that only details you want public are there, let&#8217;s open things up. It&#8217;s been just over 2 months and more than 300,000 people have updated their details so it&#8217;s time to do what we&#8217;ve been really excited to do since we first announced profiles:</p>\n<p><strong>As of right now, your profile page on Gravatar.com is open to public linking!</strong></p>\n<p>People have been emailing us, asking when they could start linking to this new, centralized identity point. The answer is &#8220;now.&#8221; You can quickly and easily set up a single place that includes to all your contact details, links to other online profiles and websites, plus includes a little information about yourself.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re really looking forward to seeing what people do with their profiles, and we&#8217;ve made a few additional changes so that they are even more useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile pages are completely public, and accessible via nice short links, for example <a href="http://gravatar.com/beau">http://gravatar.com/beau</a> (get your link from the bottom of your profile page)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve improved our support for translations, and are now <a href="http://blog.gravatar.com/2010/05/31/gravatar-localization/">looking for your help</a> to get the Gravatar website translated into as many languages as possible</li>\n<li><a href="http://foursquare.com">foursquare</a> and <a href="http://tripit.com">TripIt</a> have been added to the list of accounts you can confirm via Gravatar (let us know in the comments if there are specific services you&#8217;d like to see supported)</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re no longer limited to 140 characters when writing your bio, so go nuts and tell everyone your life story!</li>\n<li>That old profile editor of ours was way too ugly and hard to use, so we&#8217;ve made it easier to use and to see what&#8217;s going on (and to add more options, such as&#8230;)</li>\n<li>Custom Backgrounds! Upload any image or pick any color and set it as the background for your public profile page. Here&#8217;s mine with some freshly-cut grass as the background:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/beau-lebens-san-francisco-ca-gravatar-profile-1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-205  aligncenter" title="Gravatar Profile with custom background" src="http://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/beau-lebens-san-francisco-ca-gravatar-profile-1.png?w=300&#038;h=215" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a></p>\n<p>As always, if you don&#8217;t want any of your information to be public, then please just log into your account and go to &#8220;<a href="http://gravatar.com/profiles/edit/">Edit My Profile</a>&#8221; to remove those details.

Core WordPress checks to see if the Apache mod_rewrite module is loaded before fully enabling permalinks.  If that check fails then it includes index.php in your permalink structure in order to make sure that WordPress still gets a chance to process URLs.</p>\n<p>Servers using Nginx are able to do URL rewriting, but the check still fails, leaving index.php in the permalink.  Fortunately a few lines of PHP in a plugin (I like to put it in wp-content/mu-plugins/nginx.php) can fix that:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php;">\nadd_filter( ''got_rewrite'', ''nginx_has_rewrite'', 999 );\nfunction nginx_has_rewrite( $got_rewrite ) {\n    return TRUE;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Those few lines of PHP will tell WordPress that full URL rewriting is available on the server, so no more index.php in the permalink structure.</p>\n<p>Before adding this make sure that you&#8217;ve already setup URL rewriting in your Nginx configuration.</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> In the <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2010/06/wordpress-pretty-permalinks-with-nginx/#comment-33849">comments Sivel mentioned another alternative</a>:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php;">\nadd_filter( ''got_rewrite'', ''__return_true'', 999 );\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>__return_true</code> function was added during WP 3.0 development for exactly these sorts of things, where you want to just return TRUE for a filter.

Holmes is a UX Architect Evangelist at Microsoft.com,  where he works hard to bridge the gaps that exist in technology adoption and Microsoft  and open source projects. In the past, Josh used <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/DasBlogML">DasBlogML</a> and he migrated  it to WordPress quite easily. On the show, Josh shared with us many of the  projects and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/wordpress/">contributions</a> Microsoft is making to the WordPress community.  Among those plugins created by the Microsoft  team is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">Windows  Azure Storage for WordPress</a> with is similar to Amazon Web Services or  Rackspace Cloudfiles. Among the more interesting was learning how WordPress can  be run using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/wordpress/#tabs-2">Microsoft  SQL Serve</a>r for the database store as shown on sites like <a href="http://oddlyspecific.com/">oddlyspecific.com</a> for example with <a href="http://ruslany.net/2010/03/make-wordpress-faster-on-iis-with-wincache-1-1/">performance</a> <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/ksingla/archive/2010/05/27/wordpress-widget-to-show-wincache-statistics.aspx">enhancements</a>.

/></p>\n<p>Ms. Bates, your carefully chosen words say volumes.</p>\n<p>Not to confuse people with the facts, but not only does Twitter Tools give you fine grain control over your decision to send (or not send) <em>each post</em> to Twitter, it even has a feature that prevents posts from being tweeted if they were published before you installed Twitter Tools. Could there be a bug? Sure (though it&#8217;s unlikely that I wouldn&#8217;t have heard about it before now), but that&#8217;s not really the point is it?</p>\n<p>The &#8220;don&#8217;t tweet old posts&#8221; feature was <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2008/04/13/twitter-tools-12b1">added in version 1.2b1 back in 2008</a>. It was added solely because people requested it; it certainly wasn&#8217;t something I needed &#8211; just trying to make things better for the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Of course for every group of people you satisfy by adding a feature, you&#8217;ll have an equal number of people requesting the opposite:</p>\n<p class="center"><a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/395610"><img src="http://alexking.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Picture-5-300x95.png" alt="Can&#039;t make everyone happy" title="Can&#039;t make everyone happy" width="300" height="95" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4382" /></a></p>\n<p>The joys of building software and giving it away for free.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The irony of course is that I was getting set to start coding on a rewrite of Twitter Tools this evening (since there is a <a href="http://countdowntooauth.com/" rel="external">deadline looming</a>), but comments like the ones above really take the wind out of my sails.</p>\n<p>The combination of an evolving set of best-practices in WordPress core and extremely high expectations from the WordPress user community has plugin developers in a tough spot these days.</p>\n<p>I hired someone this summer for the sole purpose of updating all of our publicly released plugins/themes from the best practices of the time to the best practices in WP 3.0 (along with a few added features, bug fixes and enhancements). That&#8217;s the entire job. I expect it to take about 4-6 months to update the ~30 plugins/themes in question.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s an expense I decided we should take on for the good of the community. The cost of the developer&#8217;s salary alone is <em>way</em> more than the total donations received on all of the plugins (over a 5-6 year period) &#8211; not to mention the time spent creating them in the first place, updating them, etc.</p>\n<p>There are many things in the WordPress community that are great. There are also many things that need to continue to evolve and improve.</p>\n<p>Enough ranting, I&#8217;ll go back to working on something more productive&#8230;</p>\n<img src="http://alexking.org/wp/?ak_action=api_record_view&id=4380&type=feed" alt="" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 Jun 2010 02:59:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Gravatar: How Global Can We Go?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"https://gravatar.wordpress.com/?p=199";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"http://blog.gravatar.com/2010/05/31/gravatar-localization/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3230:"<p>Gravatar has always been about GLOBALLY Recognized Avatars.

Our buddies over at <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> are hosting a <a href="http://glotpress.org/">GlotPress</a> installation for us that will allow you all to contribute to the translation process online, with nothing but a web browser. All you need to do to get started is head over to <strong><a href="http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/gravatar">the Gravatar project</a></strong>, log in using your WordPress.com/Gravatar account and start translating strings!</p>\n<p><a href="http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/gravatar"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-200" title="Gravatar &lt; GlotPress" src="http://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/gravatar-glotpress.png?w=274&#038;h=300" alt="" width="274" height="300" /></a></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve imported all previous translations to get things started, and you&#8217;ll find some nifty tools in GlotPress, including the ability to use Google Translate for a bit of a head start. Strings are also prioritized according to where they appear within the website (so that we get the most important ones translated first). If you&#8217;d like to work on a language that isn&#8217;t currently listed, please let us know via an email to support [at] gravatar.com and we&#8217;ll get things set up for you.</p>\n<p>Once each translation gets near completion, we&#8217;ll get it online so that everyone can benefit from seeing the Gravatar.com website in their native language.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re really looking forward to making Gravatar even more global than ever with your help!</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/gravatar.wordpress.com/199/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.gravatar.com&blog=1886259&post=199&subd=gravatar&ref=&feed=1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 31 May 2010 21:49:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Beau Lebens";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WordPress.tv: WordPress 3.0 on the Horizon – Submit Your Videos!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.wordpress.tv/?p=149";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://blog.wordpress.tv/2010/05/31/wordpress-3-video-submissions/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3599:"<p>This past Thursday, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2010/05/lucky-seven/">WordPress turned seven</a>, an impressive feat and an awesome reminder of just how much this community has grown since WordPress first arrived.

WordPress users will be looking for help with these new features. You might be the teacher they need to advance their knowledge of their favorite publishing platform. Have you been working with the beta versions of WordPress 3.0? Are you a developer, designer, or power user? We feature great tutorials from WordPress users around the world on WordPress.tv, and you too can be a WordPress.tv Producer.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve created a video tutorial that you&#8217;d like to see published on WordPress.tv, <a href="http://wordpress.tv/contact/">please drop us an email</a> and let us know what you&#8217;ve made.

everyone and welcome to yet another installment of WordPress Theme Releases proudly brought to you by Weblog Tools Collection. I realize we just had a release post a couple of days ago but a few great themes popped up in our forums so I thought I would bring them to your attention right away.</p>\n<h4><a title="Clean Green: www.dynamicwp.net" href="http://www.dynamicwp.net/free-themes/clean-green-theme/">Clean Green</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/CleanGreen.png" alt="" title="CleanGreen" width="200" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8131" /></p>\n<p>The folks at DynamicWP have been turning out some fantastic themes as of late and their latest offering Clean Green is no different. As the name implies, green is the dominant colour of this theme. The various shades of green used in this theme go well together. Clean Green comes with a widgetized right sidebar and a widgetized 3 column footer. Flickr and Twitter streams are built-in and appear as widgets on the widget screen. From the theme&#8217;s options page you can use a custom logo, a custom Gravatar and exclude both pages and categories from the horizontal navigation menu. From there you can also insert your Twitter, RSS and E-mail feed link among other things.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://empirethemes.com/cumulus-a-portfolio-theme/" title="Cumulus: empirethemes.com">Cumulus</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cumulus.png" alt="" title="cumulus" width="200" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8132" /></p>\n<p>Empire Themes (formerly known as refueled) has cranked up their theme design a notch or two and have been busy turning out some excellent themes. One of the first themes I ever used years ago was a design called Ad Clerum by refueled so I am very familiar with their work.</p>\n<p>Cumulus is their latest release and is perfect for use as a portfolio theme. Setting up the theme is quite easy. Simply create a new Page called &#8220;Portfolio&#8221; and use the accompanying Portfolio Page Template. Then create a new category also called &#8220;Portfolio&#8221;. Now, when adding a new post you will see a new form field under the write post box called Portfolio Post: Image Location where you add the URL of the image you want to include. It also comes with its own options page. Coming soon is a matching bbPress theme.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://paycheckworld.com/fantastic-dream/" title="Fantastic Dream: paycheckworld.com">Fantastic Dream</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fantastic-dream.png" alt="" title="fantastic-dream" width="200" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8133" /></p>\n<p>Fantastic Dream is a light coloured theme with a widgetized right sidebar and built-in tabber powered by jQuery. From the theme&#8217;s options page you can easily change the header image.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://www.polaraul.com/2010/05/simplicity-reloaded-theme/" title="Simplicity Reloaded: www.polaraul.com">Simplicity Reloaded</a></h4>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/simplicityreloaded.png" alt="" title="simplicityreloaded" width="200" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8134" /></p>\n<p>Simplicity Reloaded is a simple yet elegant looking theme. It features built-in breadcrumb navigation and social bookmarking functions.</p>\n<p>We hope you have enjoyed this post and as always, if you have any comments, questions or suggestions feel free to drop them in the comments section below.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 31 May 2010 16:21:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Len Kutchma";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 05/31";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=8126";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/05/31/wordpress-plugin-releases-for-0531/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1833:"<p>Good morning everyone.

That combined with the large typeface makes it easy to concentrate on the content. From the theme&#8217;s options page you can set a custom logo, include a Twitter link and offer an email subscription via Feedburner. You can also select some custom text to display in the sidebar.</p>\n<h4><a title="Paino: www.polaraul.com" href="http://www.polaraul.com/2010/05/paino-theme/">Paino</a></h4>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8120" title="painoTheme" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/painoTheme.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="186" /></p>\n<p>Polaraul.com brings us Paino, a simple and generic theme featuring a widgetized left sidebar and dressed in an easy-on-the-eyes pastel colour palette. It has breadcrumb navigation built-in.</p>\n<h4><a title="Clean Simple White: wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/clean-simple-white">Clean Simple White</a></h4>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8121" title="clean-simple-white" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/clean-simple-white.png" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></p>\n<p>Another simple and clean-looking design. The use of blue for hyperlinks fits in nicely with the general appearance of this theme. It features a widgetized right sidebar as well as a widgetized 3 column footer. From the options page you can set a custom favicon as well as set up the latest Tweet widget.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/calotropis" title="Calotropis: wordpress.org">Calotropis</a></h4>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8122" title="calotropis" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/calotropis.png" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></p>\n<p>This is a theme that comes packed with all sorts of goodies. From the theme&#8217;s options page you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>choose to display right sidebar, left sidebar, sidebars on either side of the main content or no sidebar at all</li>\n<li>select magazine-type layout or traditional blog layout</li>\n<li>pick one of 5 colour schemes</li>\n<li>adjust the width of the sidebar and wrapper</li>\n<li>select a custom header and background</li>\n<li>decide how to display the horizontal navigation menu</li>\n<li>even decide how many words to display when using excerpts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s not all.

Take a look at some of their <a href="http://animoto.com/showcase">sample videos</a> to see what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n<p>I just found out today that Animoto have added Gravatar support, so now when you leave comments on a video over there, you&#8217;ll see something like this:</p>\n<p><a href="http://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/animoto-miller_s-wedding.png"><img

As you all know you try out a lot of stuff on your site – mine had 3 years worth of it in there!</p>\n<p>Of course I had uninstalled the theme or plugin but a majority of these do not remove the information they leave in your database.&#160; </p>\n<p>Now I am not a developer and I have never claimed to be one nor will I.&#160; However, I do believe this is a situation that can be resolved.</p>\n<p>You see there are quite a few plugins and themes in the WordPress repository that already have this feature built in and I have used a few.</p>\n<p>For example – the <a href="http://lesterchan.net/portfolio/programming/php/#wp-dbmanager">WP-DBManager plugin by Lester Chan</a> does this.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/wpdbmanageruninstall.png" rel="thumbnail"><img title="wpdbmanageruninstall" border="0" alt="wpdbmanageruninstall" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/wpdbmanageruninstall_thumb.png" width="244" height="127" /></a>&#160; </p>\n<p>This is the uninstall page for the WP-DBManager and as you can see it will remove database information if you opt to <em>uninstall</em> the plugin.&#160; If your just deactivating it or lets say upgrading it then the options in the database will remain intact.</p>\n<p>If this can be done then why not across the board. Why not make this a standard for inclusion in the WordPress Extend site?&#160; If your plugin or theme deposits information into a users database then provide an uninstall option to remove that data/tables.</p>\n<p>What do you all think about this?

It means we think we&#8217;ve got everything done: all features finished, all bugs squashed, and all potential issues addressed. But, then, with over 20 million people using WordPress with a wide variety of configurations and hosting setups, it&#8217;s entirely possible that we&#8217;ve missed something. So! For the brave of heart, please download the RC and test it out (but not on your live site unless you&#8217;re extra adventurous). Some things to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom menus are finished! Yay!</li>\n<li>Multi-site is all set.</li>\n<li>The look of the WordPress admin has been lightened up a little bit, so you can focus more on your content.</li>\n<li>There are a ton of changes, so plugin authors, please test your plugins <strong>now</strong>, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can figure it out before the final release.</li>\n<li>Plugin and theme *users* are also encouraged to test things out. If you find problems, let your plugin/theme authors know so they can figure out the cause.</li>\n<li>There are a couple of <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/feed/ http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">known issues</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are testing the RC and come across a bug, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Report it on the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>\n<li>Join the dev chat and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>\n<li>File a bug ticket on the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=reopened&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reviewing&amp;status=new&amp;status=accepted&amp;group=status&amp;milestone=3.0">WordPress Trac </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing with the 3.0 RC as much as we&#8217;ve enjoyed making it for you.

It seems like just yesterday we were fresh to the world, a new entrant to a market  everyone said was already saturated. (As a side note, if the common perception is that a market is finished and that everything interesting has been done already, it&#8217;s probably a really good time to enter it.)</p>\n<p>The growth over the past year has blown me away. Since our last birthday we&#8217;ve doubled theme downloads to over 10 million, and doubled plugin downloads to 60 million. Most importantly, we continued to grow the development community to 1,528 people active on Trac and 13 committers, both numbers the highest in the history of WordPress.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s 1,528 people pouring their hearts and souls into GPL software we all own, we all build on, we can use as we please, we can all make better. We&#8217;ve evolved from a simple script to a web platform.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re on the cusp of version 3.0, with a release candidate coming out any minute now.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to celebrate WordPress&#8217;s birthday with us &#8212; tell a friend! Help them upgrade their blog or find the perfect theme. Talk about how WordPress is built by and for a community. Drop in to help test 3.0, including all the plugins you use. Write something to take advantage of the new 3.0 features, or teach your friends how to. If you buy any themes or plugins, make sure they&#8217;re GPL or compatible just like WordPress. We&#8217;ve got a long road ahead of us, it&#8217;s important that we not forget that Open Source got us this far, and is the only way we&#8217;re going to get to the next level. The whole of what we can build together is far greater than the sum of our parts.

If you have the val allele, you have a lot less dopamine in your prefrontal cortex, which means that your memory, IQ, and executive cognition is impaired. So the val allele makes you sort of dumb, so why doesn''t it go away?\r\n\r\nThe val allele is actually more common than mets.\r\nHaving the met allele, although it brings higher intelligence, IQ, memory, and executive function, makes you a little neurotic. It is associated with higher risk for depression, anxiety, schizophrenia - the met is the more emotional, deep thinker. The val allele is the more "guns and muscles" brain, with poorer executive function like memory, but he is emotionally a lot more stable.\r\n\r\nThe COOL thing is that this is a prime example of a gene environment interaction, or balanced selection. The one polymorphism leads to two different types of people, both of which we need. We might need the mets for laying down the law and solving problems, and the vals for keeping the walls of the fort up.\r\n\r\nHaha, so how introspective are you?

That is the nature of life. In that mindset, I''d like to say some final things. I ''m a lot more articulate with key than with word, making this note my expression of choice. Here goes.\r\n\r\nMy time here has ended wonderfully, been challenging at times, and I am most grateful for the things that I have learned about myself, and the questions that this environment elicited in me that might still need answers. I came here as a sophomore knowing absolutely no one, a large feat given the size and plastic-wrapped nature of this institution. I''ve many a times said that, in retrospect, I would not have transferred, and from an academic standpoint and examination of the large social structure, perhaps this is true. But when I zoom in to the people that I have come to care about here, I am certain that coming here has only broadened and enlivened my life.\r\n\r\nI am grateful for the people that have made my experience very rich, the professors that have challenged me, and the few that were there for me during some of the harder times. My early to bed - early to rise and tendency to be introverted make me a more challenging friend to keep, and I am so grateful to you guys that consistently poked me to keep the connection strong.\r\n\r\nTo all of my friends: When I think back to my time at Duke, I''m going to remember Sitar Sundays, Crowell being the best and baddest dorm with a pimp RA crew, the many times I wrinkled my nose or teared from laughing so hard, baking like a wild woman at Smart Home, and all seemingly insignificant number of times that we ate out and bonded over chicken, awkward waiters, and discussion about... oh you know :P\r\n\r\nMemories are of a nature that they don''t store in complete sentences or images, so that is how I will share them, in a mental burp, one thing leading to the next. I''ll probably add to this as I think of good memories, but here is a start.\r\n\r\n1) TWINS!!! First gergz and BG, and now Ravi and Jayson backpack twins.\r\n2) The Grants... potench. potench.\r\n3) Ravi''s sweet-ass car... (or might I say, sweet ass-car, hehe), many walks to and from the Blue Zone, somehow getting 4 people across the backseat and to the destination like cozy sardines.\r\n4) Gergz magoo and his love of shredded wheat. 2nd dinner, 3rd dinner, you know.. shooshoopeedoo!\r\n5) Bryan and Gergz monopolizing the name game with characters from Bleach... yeaaah!\r\n6) How everyone always got rotisserie chicken with two sides, and Greg scammed them to get an extra one, and I never could do it.\r\n7) Rhut''s awesomely dry and direct sense of humor, and thanks for giving me proper instructions about crossing my legs when I''m wearing a dress, hehe.\r\n8) Bryan flexing at the most unexpected, and completely funny times with appropriate facial expressions\r\n9) Andy, Lo Lo!\r\n10) Class with Ken, BG, and Z Spring of sophomore year, making little cute Flash videos and finding excuses to watch random stuff on YouTube in class. Nice!\r\n11) FAAIL! WIN!\r\n12) CanIhaveitCanIhaveit?\r\n13) My one crazy dance night at Parizade - I might never be able to stay up that late again, but man, that was fun.\r\n14) Phil doing the night elf dance on top of the arts warehouse, ftw!\r\n15) Niiiiiice!\r\n16) Sash, Phil, and Raffi, we had some amazing times in ISIS, like, everyday was awesome! Ghost ride tha whip, yo!\r\n17) Z - Sapachi! I''ll just say it... we were badass! And it was really fun. I''m really excited for you about that company you will be working for... their logo is incredibly cute, and on that observation alone I think it''s going to be a hit!\r\n18) Link! Ravi, the few times that I went to the link to join you studying. It was a push for me, because libraries are frightening, but I got to see your determination and work ethic. I''m never going to forget Plowbear, or how easily you laughed and made everyone feel good. I really look up to you for your ability to find balance.\r\n19) Congyi, creme brulee. and FIRE!\r\n20) Mark, Rui, and Mia... and the amazing 3 day video project-that-probably-needed-3-months, and we still rocked it.\r\n21) Thanksgiving at Smart Home, best of my life! PIE DAY! and Salssaaaa!\r\n22) Disney movies, Scrubs, and thai food with Preeyanka and Jo, and cooking to music and not being afraid to belt it out!\r\n23) Ying-ying always finding time to join the crew, and I will be forever grateful for letting me borrow those dresses!\r\n24) Threadless T-shirts, Fail blog, TED talks, and thisiswhyyourfat blog rock my world.\r\n25) Life conversations with Percy while I pedaled and talked away, making him yet again late for swim class.\r\n26) Duck sauce from Panda Express, ty Jason for bringing me it special! And thank you for always giving me a call to grab dinner, and pushing me to leave my little introverted shell to have some amazing experience I wouldn''t have otherwise had! You''ve been a great friend, you''re a great listener, and you''re going to be an exceptional doctor! :)\r\n27) My birthday celebration at the Loop, surrounded by good friends\r\n28) The infamous walk back from central the night of parizade, coming up with clever phrases for the YouTube video... "my $#%@, variet-ee bucket... your @#%#, chick-en nugget!"\r\n29) Bryan''s big stomach, and that turd waiter that stole my dinner. Z, thanks for standing up for me!\r\n30) Gingerbread house making event. Megan, your house was lovely. Jason made a tower that looked like it came from a five year old, and Mark and Tim went for the train that looked like a phallic symbol, hehe\r\n31) How no matter where we go, Torero''s always wins.\r\n32) Dayo I''m-a-big-boy!!! getting surprised to run into you at Brugger''s and having good conversation that always brightened my day before class!\r\n33) Ravi''s super room fan, ftw!\r\n34) Andy''s sweet apartment for hosting dinners... with lasagna and pancakes. I''ve never seen such a large bag of pancake mix.\r\n35) The passing of the RA room from Sarah to Jason, and how my first room in Crowell when they moved me there Spring of sophomore year used to be the empty hankypanky room. haha.\r\n36) Mario Kart and Ping Pong at Rhut, BG, Matt, and Z''s house.\r\n37) Cereal with Kiril, always fantastic. Kiril, you put so much energy into us, and deserved so much more than a cake! You are the BEST GR on campus, hands down!\r\n38) The wine tasting... hehe.\r\n39) Jason telling Ravi he has beautiful eyes, and Ravi saying "shh not here!"\r\n40) The back of yo'' head is ridikulus\r\n41) Trevor and Menelik''s hot wing challenge at Chai''s.

ONE OF YOUR SCARS, HOW DID YOU GET IT?\r\nMy most interesting scars are from big surgeries. If you see the location, you''ll know the surgery... hard to get around that.\r\n\r\n2. WHAT IS ON THE WALLS IN YOUR ROOM?\r\nBlown up pictures of friends, a la e-print and an app from Jayzoo\r\n\r\n3.

DO YOU GET SCARED IN THE DARK?\r\nI prefer falling asleep in complete darkness. I used to be afraid of a toe biting monster when I was a kid, but the solution to that fear isn''t light... rather a securely tucked blanket.\r\n\r\n12. THE LAST PERSON TO MAKE YOU CRY?\r\nWell, my friend made me cry, because I was laughing so hard :)\r\n\r\n13. WHAT''S YOUR WORST FEAR?\r\nDrowning under ice in a lake... *shudder*\r\n\r\n14. WHAT KIND OF HAIR/EYE COLOR DO YOU LIKE ON THE OPPOSITE SEX?\r\nOh that''s so easy. Dark dark dark dark. Not even dark brown, closer to black, or so dark brown it looks black.\r\n\r\n15.

HAVE YOU BEEN OUT OF THE USA?\r\nYes, I''ve traveled to the Dominican Republic\r\n\r\n35. YOUR WEAKNESSES?\r\nI set expectations that can be both too high for my own good, and for others as well. My perfectionism and sense of time urgency is probably sometimes a strength, and sometimes a pretty bad quality to have.\r\n\r\n36. MET ANYONE FAMOUS?\r\nI saw Q from Star Trek in a book store when I was in high school. He looked really old.\r\n\r\n37. FIRST JOB?\r\nIce cream scooper! So much fun :)\r\n\r\n38. EVER DONE A PRANK CALL?\r\nActually, I have... in the 3rd grade my friend and I called a completely random number, said something silly, and hung up.\r\n\r\n39. DO YOU THINK EVERYONE OUT THERE HAS A SOULMATE?\r\nI''m not sure, and I don''t have any base for evaluating that claim\r\n\r\n40. WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEFORE YOU FILLED THIS OUT?\r\nFinishing up philosophy essays about Dennett''s "Where Am I" (personal identity), Jackson''s "knowledge argument," for qualia, and how the physicalist explains (or can''t explain) how the brain has original intentionality.\r\n\r\n41. HAVE YOU EVER HAD SURGERY?\r\nOh hell yes, I''m a pro.\r\n\r\n42. WHAT DO YOU GET COMPLIMENTED ABOUT MOST?\r\nProbably the isha necklace that I always wear\r\n\r\n43.

WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LUNCH MEAT?\r\nProbably turkey... although I''m generally not an avid consumer of lunch meat. It''s slimy.\r\n\r\n52. ANY BAD HABITS?\r\nYeah, I always give myself hang nails. And it seems to be in an effort to get rid of them. Silly girl.\r\n\r\n53. ARE YOU A JEALOUS PERSON?\r\nI think if I were in a relationship and there were other girls hanging around, I could be jealous, but it wouldn''t last long because I would act on it. In terms of other girls? No, I''ve never been aware of another girl having a quality or looking in a way that I''d want to have/look.\r\n\r\n54. IF YOU WERE ANOTHER PERSON, WOULD YOU BE FRIENDS WITH YOU?\r\nNo, probably not. I''ve answered this question as well... I''m way too introverted.\r\n\r\n55. DO YOU AGREE WITH FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?\r\nJust thinking about being physical with someone in absence of any emotional connection makes me sick to my stomach. Not only do I disagree, I am repulsed by the idea.\r\n\r\n56. DO LOOKS MATTER?\r\nThey always do.\r\n\r\n57. HOW DO YOU RELEASE ANGER?\r\nI feel anxiety mostly as my negative emotion, and I deal with that by running. I wish I could sleep it off, but it tends to make me sleep less.\r\n\r\n58.WOULD YOU RATHER GAIN 58 POUNDS OR LOSE 58 POUNDS.\r\nOh god, I don''t think I''d be alive if I lost 58 pounds, but I don''t want to gain that much either, that wouldn''t be healthy.\r\n\r\n59. WHAT''S YOUR MAIN GOAL IN LIFE?\r\nTo get through it in a way that feels good?\r\n\r\n60. WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE TOY AS A CHILD?\r\nFirst brio and lego, then Sega Genesis with my brother\r\n\r\n61.

(42, 1, '2009-02-01 16:36:32', '2009-02-01 20:36:32', 'It’s really wonderful to feel like part of a group. it goes along with this fundamental human “need to belong” that one of my psychology Professors, Mark Leary, has been studying for quite some time. However, there seems to be a conflicting dynamic that works with this need to belong that I believe leads to what we observe as a hook up culture. On the one hand, it feels good to feel like part of a group, but on the other hand, it feels terrible to be rejected. There seems to be a difference between inclusion and exclusion. To be included means to be invited to things, share inside jokes, and have a common understanding that you fit well within some social fabric. To be excluded, on the other hand, can be overt or subtle. An overt exclusion is someone going out of their way to send you a strong message that you are different, or don’t belong with the group, or are closer to belonging to an “outgroup.” A subtle exclusion might be as simple as someone or a group of people that you thought you were close with doing something together and not telling you about it, even if it was spur of the moment and inviting you wouldn’t have been natural. In this case, the exclusion is really more of a perception on your side of the cranium. Regardless of the incentive or reason for exclusion, it makes us feel badly either way. So we generally govern our lives possibly not to take part in every social situation that crosses our paths, but to minimize the chances of being excluded. So I may not want to participate, but I sure as heck want the invite!\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean, on a day to day basis, for how we interact with people? It leads to larger friend groups with more people and weaker connections. It means that when the desire to connect with people comes about, we send a mass group email of the flavor “does anyone want to do X” as opposed to a personal message to one other person. It means that even if we desire more emotional intimacy with a friend, it’s incredibly hard to pursue because there is the risk of scaring them off with a need, and in the process being more separated from the larger group you are both affiliated with. Thus, it is safer to seek social fulfillment in a larger, more impersonal context than reveal more and take chances on few people. It also means that when those times come around when we do need to talk to that one person, we find ourselves surrounded with many, acquainted with wonderful people, but not quite close enough to be able to call anyone, and ask to stop by for a hug.\r\n\r\nI find this on my mind because it’s very apparent to me how many kids here at school work so hard to play it cool. The boy on the bus sits in a certain way, is dressed in a certain way, takes off his glasses in a certain way, to send the message that he is suave, collected, and untouchable. The worker outers at the gym that approah the pullup bar aren’t so much into the pullups but making them a performance of brute strength and muscle to envy. Many of my customers seem to be worried that their choice of lunch for the day sends a pariticular message about them to me, to their friends, or even the people around them. Even with eye contact, passing someone by, people work so hard to be it all that a huge component of realness is just gone. People speak in cliche’s, use the same expressions and gestures, and hide serious thoughts and emotions behind a facade of their choice, for whatever is appropriate for the situation. Because acting any differently, or maybe doing what you really want to do or something that feels more true to yourself, may not be looked upon favorably by someone. Yes, you might be excluded, so to compensate you do what you perceive as necessary to be most socially accepted. This is where superficiality, or fakeness, grows from.\r\nAnd I find it tiring. How I love to put energy into others because it makes me feel close to them, and it feels good, but how tiring it is to be just another person included in a mass email. How I wish to get closer to some of my friends, but that’s not possible in a large group of people afraid to bring down their facade. But on the other thing, it’s a nice thing to have superficiality, because there are people that I have no desire to get close to, or know more about, and the established social structure and superficiality allows me to deal with them and move on with my day. It’s just a fact that you can only maintain so many friendships at one time, and it makes sense to maintain the most valuable ones.\r\n\r\nIt’s probably a good thing that I’m graduating, because I’ve reached a point when the same large group dynamic is getting old. I’m not sure if this is a sign of gaining more maturity or possibly just getting tired of the daily performance of life, but I crave, selfishly, to feel connected to one or two people, that I might trust wholeheartedly and revel in understanding each others strengths, weaknesses, imperfections, and all those things that make human beings interesting and real. News flash, emotions and imperfections doesn’t equate to being weak or a bad friend and does not mean that you will be rejected. Sometimes these things can turn people away, but then I’d argue if the person is uncomfortable with your degree of desire for emotional connectedness, it wasn’t a friendship match in the first place.\r\nI think, for my generation at least, that the current culture works, at least in the life of a busy college student. I do strongly believe, however, that a time will come when many realize that this dynamic isn’t enough for the human heart. That even the most achievement oriented and busy/important/go-getters have moments when meeting a deadline or going to a group dinner could never feed the same hunger that sitting down and talking with one person might. I can speak for myself… I’m incredibly highly traited in the “go-getter” dimension, and sometimes doing that go-getter thing is missing a component of shared investment.\r\n\r\nMy mind is on this tread of thinking because, for myself, I know that I am terrified of relying on others, and of relinquishing my self sufficiency. I think that my best efforts to maintain a feeling of connectedness with my friends is to do little nice things for them… possibly in fear of losing my social ties I feel good to do these things because it is an assurance of maintaining connection. With this dynamic I can maintain my belongingness without ever sacrificing self sufficiency. But I do realize that, for when a large stressor does hit me unexpectedly, I have not allowed myself to get close enough to anyone to feel OK about calling them for that hug. It’s primarly the Type-A orientedness of my personality that I attribute to this need for self sufficiency, because I feel huge accomplishment and pride in forever doing things early and efficienty. This is what has driven my desire and now natural tendency to wake up early, finish things hugely in advance, and always have backup plans for everything. I believe that as long as life stays away from large tumbles that I’ve had in the past, I have enough insight into myself to maintain smooth sailing. I can’t imagine that I can be hit harder than I already have, so my skin is thick, but I better knock on wood for that one. Be right back.\r\n\r\nI can forsee, and know from experience, that life is not predictible, and I know that there will be times when I have questions and can’t think up an answer, or maybe just need some reassurance and a hug, when my self sufficiency just won’t replace someone that cares about me. I’d say that the observation of giving and receiving affection in what I perceive to be my culture has been one of my biggest conflicts in that I desire that same dynamic but feel iffy about applying it to my own life. But with these desires in mind and knowledge about myself and the people I enjoy spending time with, this might help me find those few that I will be able to just show up, and jump on for a hug. Yes, that will be a wonderful connection. Homework time!

(44, 1, '2008-11-22 14:08:27', '2008-11-22 18:08:27', 'For the first time in many years, I’ve decided to do something based on wanting to do it, as opposed to doing what others want me to do. I’ve been getting accustomed to pursuing what makes me happy on a daily basis, but for the longest time, unable to apply this thinking when considering the future. It’s taken years of being pulled and stretched to finally be able to do this. And for the first time in my life, I feel what I might call a solid future footing, or an inner peace that completes my sense of self or identity.\r\n\r\n<strong>A JOURNEY:</strong> I’ll describe the path that I’ve taken at Duke to come to this place. It’s been really hard. I’ve been anxious, sad, and confused at times, lost and then under and illusion of guidance. I came here not knowing much about myself other than I was talented at a lot of things, and needed to do a lot of exploration to figure out which talent might further, make me most happy. I’d say that the hardest thing about having what motivational psychologists call a “need for cognition” in the domain of the self, and then being a pretty competent person in many skills is that at some point, breadth must turn to depth. What we commonly forget is that there is a difference between being good at something and being electrified by something. We commonly take a liking to things we are good at because it gives us a high feeling of self efficacy, but it may not define us. Then when we are good at something, and others regard it highly, we force ourselves into areas for the wrong reasons. Hello midlife crisis, or if you never get the insight followed by guts to be true to yourself, consistent unhappiness.\r\n\r\nI discovered early on that I was fascinated by people and behavior, and after stomping around in the econ/ public policy puddle I finally made the choice to screw everything else and just study psychology. I perceived this to be a dangerous choice at the time because it didn’t fall in line with any clear career line. As much as I loved the study, I knew (from working at a desk) that I would never be happy in a desk job, and that I just didn’t want to be a psychologist.\r\n\r\nCan’t select the right one? Get rid of the wrong ones. During my time at Duke, I’ve largely been trying things to see how much I like them. Sometimes, the easiest way to find what you like is to figure out what you don’t like. Here are some big things that I narrowed down.\r\n\r\n<strong>BIG THING #1:</strong> There is a lot of hoopla and press about this “research” thing. I mean oh my goodness, it’s what every good undergrad does… if you aren’t doing research in your chosen field then… FAIL! I tried research, twice actually, and ultimately went insane from working at a desk, and feeling forced to work in one flavor, with not enough creative outlet. It was… BORING! I also encountered many professors and students that think very highly of themselves. Heck, one even fashioned himself into a sort of brand. At first, I was impressed, maybe after talking with him/her once or twice. But what I realized, slowly over time, is that these people weren’t so fun or brilliant, they simply said the same things over and over again, and massaged their ego’s to some sort of intellectual orgasm. The more I encountered this type of person, the more I felt sick to my stomach, and sure that I never wanted to be like that. Moving on.\r\n\r\n<strong>BIG THING #2:</strong> The next “big thing” that every person at a place like Duke is forced to consider is what I might call this startup bug. It’s the sexiest thing to start your own business, and given the trend, it better have something to do with technology, something mobile, or something green. I had a lot of fun with this path, I must admit, but at the end of the day? My incentives and motives were completely based on the people I was working with… feeling like part of a team and having fun being united by the same goal. We could have been designing a new rubber-band or packaging turds, once the people component turned negative, so did the experience for me. I’m not against entrepreneurship… it is very much the path I will most likely be following maybe 15 years into the future, but it has to be in the right domain.\r\n\r\n<strong>BIG THING #3:</strong> Fall of senior year comes with a lot of “ohmygodI’mabouttograduateIneedaJOB” stress. Hello career fairs, e-recruiting, and submitting a lot of resumes to companies you aren’t sure what the hell you’d be doing. But why did I do it? Because obtaining a tangible job would give me guaranteed future success, stability, and look good to other people. Phew, right? No, not right. In the storm of anxiety I interviewed for consulting and research jobs, even did a case challenge competition, and attended every information session and panel that was available. It was in mid conversation with a partner from Deloitte when I realized, “wow, this guy is a douchebag. Being a consultant might make a lot of money, but when it comes down to it, it’s being a professional @ss kisser.” The thought of me being in that job role, again, made me sick to my stomach. I also went to a “women’s dessert event” and realized that I had absolutely nothing in common with these women, and found them a little boring, actually. Later consulting. It is a blessing in disguise that the one job at facebook that I DID interview for, I wasn’t offered. You can ask my friend Sam, before decisions were out, I was hoping that I wouldn’t get the offer to make the choice easier for me.\r\n\r\nThe social pressures of an institution can be distracting and sometimes louder than your internal voice. What happened is that this stream of exploding seniors made me forget that I would never be happy working at a desk. Once I remembered that (actually when I visited Palo Alto and saw all the little lemmings typety typety at their desks) I was quick to just cancel the rest of the desk jobs I was going to interview for. Doing so would be a waste of BOTH of our time.\r\n\r\nDon’t pidgeon hole your options for lame reasons: It was after this thought process that I realized that my squirminess with regards to my future wasn’t because I didn’t have something secured. I realized that, had I secured any of those jobs, the squirminess would have gotten worse. I realized that I was anxious and spending hours and hours mindlessly browsing easy opportunities, jobs, and graduate schools because I was severely limiting my options. The best thing for me, what my heart really wanted, I wasn’t even putting out there as an option. This is a disease of Duke… this feeling that, given I went to this school, I have to either get a REALLY GOOD job, pursue some form of graduate study (preferably in something sciencey, if you want to go for something like English or History - FAIL!) or go out and save the world, in a social or teaching sense.\r\n\r\nWe shuffle towards paths that are most accessible: I think that the majority of kids don’t really know what electrifies them, so it’s easy to latch on to options that are available, and seem do-able. A lot of graduate school (not all, mind you, but a lot) is probably pursued out of prolonging indecision, I think. It’s like, oh @#$%, I’m not really sure about what I want to do, but I can take these pre-reqs for med school, I can study for this test, and I know I can apply, hopefully get in somewhere, and then secure a future with financial and reputation-al prestige and security. I’m not saying that this is true for everyone - I’m sure that there are a group of kids out there that are electrified by the profession of medicine or law. I am just noticing a disproportionately large percentage of the student body that is enrolled along one of these courses, sometimes as a “last minute” decision, other times as a “well I declared it, and now I can’t take it back or people will think I suck,” or “heck, I’m not sure what else I’d do, this seems OK for now,” thing. Or maybe they really are convinced it’s their calling, and it might be. But once you jump on one of those wagons, Phew, your future is set, and it feels good now. If that’s the case, why aren’t people happier here? Time to make sacrifices now for that lofty future, because you might be happier then, right? On a tangent, we have this idea that given OK health, I am guaranteed a long life, and tomorrow is there. I’m of the mindset that the cancer patient is pretty much on par with you, me, no one is assured of longevity of life, the difference is having an idea about how much time you have left, and in that case, I could make an argument for wanting to be and not wanting to be the cancer patient. Anyway, back to the Duke undergrad. Okay, I’m pre-… med! law! If not that… graduate school! research! If not that… must… get…. job…. beyond that, can I really call myself a Duke graduate? I have this perception that given a certain income, title, or life-path, that will make me happy. Errrm, probably not. I think happiness is more of a personality trait that changes in degree with regards to the situation that you choose, but that’s another bucket of ladybugs.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of being true to yourself, Duke is a dangerous place. I would say that there is pressure, or even a disease, to be highly successful and achieving in the eyes of others. From the point of being accepted here to constantly being submurged in this murky pool of huge competition and academic aggogance, most of us develop (consciously or unconsciously) a feeling that, given I went to this school, I expect a certain salary, life outcome, certainty of success, once I am released. Also when you are here, if you didn’t already have it from high school, we further develop our fear of failure. I can’t tell you how many of my friends, who have the work ethic and drive to be successful, are terrified of not getting into graduate school, medical school, law school, or even getting a job or having some clear path after graduation. Heck, that’s been me this Fall. Hold up. First of all, there will always be opportunity for you given that you graduate college, let alone a brand name school like Duke. Wrong perspective. Too black and white. And if it isn’t just “out there,” then you make it. If you are unemployed for a year or go out and try something completely “crazy,” that’s OK. Not being perfect at everything doesn’t switchback to failure, and neither does maintaining some path of career certainty. It is possible to do something and not be perfect or the best and be happy. The problem here is that we perceive “not-complete success” as failure. There is this feeling that if you aren’t making a solid 60-100K upon graduation or are on a path to make more than that, you’re a waste. And if you are electrified by something that doesn’t fit in that box? Better go on salary.com and find a way to make it fit. Sucks!\r\n\r\nIt’s all so silly, we can smile about that: Guys, do you realize how silly all of this is? It might be me, but once I reached senior year, I started to look around and everyone looked really young. And the way that kids stress, work themselves to the core, and then drink like sailors is just silly. Given that I place a high emphasis on what others think of me, do I really care that much what… an 18 year old thinks about my choices? Do I really need to be concerned with how attractive I come across to these gawky self-centered frat boys? Nope! When it comes down to it, every single person here is just that, a person, and in the same boat of being in some stage in the process of self discovery. We’re all sticking our toes in different puddles to test the temperature and are a little confused. This entire campus culture, pressure to succeed, make sacrifices, not be true to yourself, is just so ridiculous. I’m not sure what the administration is up to. No, adding flat screen TVs to unnecessary places doesn’t make people happier, or doing construction to make the campus even more impressive and uncomfortable, sorry!\r\n\r\nSo in this mindset, I’ve relaxed a lot. I’m not so worried about what other people think that I’m doing, I sort of just do what moves me. It feels wonderful, and it feels free, but getting here was a huge suckfest. I am certain that I’ve been force to deal with things that most don’t even consider until later life. But in order to learn, and in order to grow, you have to survive adversity and make it through challenge. Nothing will ever be learned from a life of safety, privilege, acceptance, and easiness.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Suckfest:</strong> Along this line of self discovery I had three large buckets of bad things poured on me. I had my heart elated and broken, I had three nasty surgeries that made me realize that life was no guarantee, and I had an identity stomp when I stopped running competitively. Let me summarize what I learned.\r\n\r\n<strong>1)</strong> I learned that I have to pursue and put energy into the people, things, activities, and ideas that make me happy, regardless of others, because at the end of the day, the one person I have to report to is myself, and it’s always the case that when I feel anxiety or unhappy about something I haven’t stayed true to myself. What does this mean? It means really following your heart, and not just convincing yourself that you are. It means not changing your style of dress, behavior, or personality to be better liked. It means dropping people from your life that make you feel crappy, and surrounding yourself with people that make you feel good. In terms of my running, it had lost its previous passion because I was running for everyone but myself. As soon as I left the team I gradually re-found the fulfillment that was lost. It’s a little contradictory, but I now run more than I ever have, and I love it.\r\n\r\n<strong>2)</strong> I learned that communication and honesty are always the best policy. It’s a good and a bad thing to have a very thin filter between my mind and my lips, but I figure that anyone who is offended by my thought content and style probably isn’t a good friend match anyway. I also appreciate people who are open and honest with me, who I perceive to be more “real.”\r\n\r\n<strong>3)</strong> I know that I score highly on this personality dimension called the “need to belong.” I am most fulfilled by connecting with people, by making them happy. If you want to make me really happy, make me a part of something you are doing, or come along with me in something I’m doing. If you want to hurt me, do something that alienates me, is dishonest, or manipulative. A few times of hurt, I can forgive and move on, but I know myself well, and there is a certain line of squirminess that people can cross when I feel the automatic necessity to make a social cut.\r\n\r\n<strong>4)</strong> Having someone to love was like this forbidden fruit, that once I lost it, not only was the rejection painful, I wanted it back and felt incomplete without it. I realized through this process that life is most fulfilling when you are whole in yourself, and having something like a relationship isn’t even necessary. It sucks that society sends a prominent message that being single is akin to being incomplete, and that you should want a relationship. I can’t say either way whether I will stumble upon this love thing again, but I am certain that I don’t need it to be happy, and that when and if it comes along, I’ll just know it. And I am of the mindset that I will not change, or feel like I need to, for anyone. And given the pressure from society, the media, it’s pretty common to evaluate the people that are currently in your life and try to pick the best one, and even potentially obsess or force something that isn’t there. DON’T DO IT! I feel like I will either know, it will happen naturally, and if I’m unaware of a potential interest, if the guy in interested enough, he will put in the energy. I’m a strong believer that if the guy doesn’t have the energy or balls to pursue me, he’s probably not interested enough in the first place. Bottom line is that friends are amazing. I will always be socially healthy when I pursue and feed good friendships.\r\n\r\n<strong>5)</strong> Be good to yourself. You won’t always be in good spirits, and you don’t always have to smile. I find it refreshing to be pissed now and then &gt;:P It’s OK to value or fall into your neutral and negative moments as it is your positive. It is in the days of high negative emotion that you need to be better to yourself. I even sometimes go as far as to view myself as another person, and make decisions about how to treat myself based on that. I felt crappy the other morning, so I went to the state park. I’m also a firm believer in doing what you want when you feel like it. I manage my time and work based on this principle… I write papers and do work when I am driven and motivated to, and in that context I am efficient and enjoy it. When I don’t feel like doing something, I stop. Yeah, sometimes things are due and you HAVE to force yourself to do it, and you might not want to. The key in this case is that if you “don’t feel like doing something” consistently enough over time, you probably shouldn’t be pursuing that thing, yo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Knowing Myself:</strong> So, after four+ years, on the journey from an old 17 to a young 22, I know myself pretty well. To be happy, I need moments of people, humor, moments alone, color, music, sweet and salty, and movement. I realize that I started this entry announcing a decision, and you’ve probably read this far hungry to find out what that decision is exactly. It is a far far future goal, based on an activity that energizes me in the present moment, that has been a passion of mine since I was a kid, but I’ve largely abandoned it since coming to college. It is very far from a desk job, puts me in a position of being self directed in my work, and being exposed constantly to creative output, color, music, and connecting with people. It fits well with my personality, emotional character, and motivational structure. It let’s me wake up with the sun, and engage in a daily routine that I find fulfilling, that I wouldn’t even consider work, but more just living. If you haven’t guessed by now, and can’t tell by now, I’m not going to tell you. It’s not technically a “set profession,” just a theme really. You can ask me in person. I can tell you that it offers no clear path, not very high salaries, but that I’ve never felt so excited about something in my life, and I’m going to work really hard at it, and be the best that I can be. I’ve finally mustered the guts to follow my heart, and the feeling is full, beautiful, and like the euphoric high after a run. It’s been scratching at my mental cat door for quite some time, gosh, took me long enough to remove the kitty blocker.\r\n\r\n:)', 'Fall Reflections', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'fall-reflections', '', '', '2010-06-05 17:47:04', '2010-06-05 21:47:04', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=44', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Heck, that’s been me this Fall. Hold up. First of all, there will always be opportunity for you given that you graduate college, let alone a brand name school like Duke. Wrong perspective. Too black and white. And if it isn’t just “out there,” then you make it. If you are unemployed for a year or go out and try something completely “crazy,” that’s OK. Not being perfect at everything doesn’t switchback to failure, and neither does maintaining some path of career certainty. It is possible to do something and not be perfect or the best and be happy. The problem here is that we perceive “not-complete success” as failure. There is this feeling that if you aren’t making a solid 60-100K upon graduation or are on a path to make more than that, you’re a waste. And if you are electrified by something that doesn’t fit in that box? Better go on salary.com and find a way to make it fit. Sucks!\n\nIt’s all so silly, we can smile about that: Guys, do you realize how silly all of this is? It might be me, but once I reached senior year, I started to look around and everyone looked really young. And the way that kids stress, work themselves to the core, and then drink like sailors is just silly. Given that I place a high emphasis on what others think of me, do I really care that much what… an 18 year old thinks about my choices? Do I really need to be concerned with how attractive I come across to these gawky self-centered frat boys? Nope! When it comes down to it, every single person here is just that, a person, and in the same boat of being in some stage in the process of self discovery. We’re all sticking our toes in different puddles to test the temperature and are a little confused. This entire campus culture, pressure to succeed, make sacrifices, not be true to yourself, is just so ridiculous. I’m not sure what the administration is up to. No, adding flat screen TVs to unnecessary places doesn’t make people happier, or doing construction to make the campus even more impressive and uncomfortable, sorry!\n\nSo in this mindset, I’ve relaxed a lot. I’m not so worried about what other people think that I’m doing, I sort of just do what moves me. It feels wonderful, and it feels free, but getting here was a huge suckfest. I am certain that I’ve been force to deal with things that most don’t even consider until later life. But in order to learn, and in order to grow, you have to survive adversity and make it through challenge. Nothing will ever be learned from a life of safety, privilege, acceptance, and easiness.\n\n<strong>The Suckfest:</strong> Along this line of self discovery I had three large buckets of bad things poured on me. I had my heart elated and broken, I had three nasty surgeries that made me realize that life was no guarantee, and I had an identity stomp when I stopped running competitively. Let me summarize what I learned.\n\n<strong>1)</strong> I learned that I have to pursue and put energy into the people, things, activities, and ideas that make me happy, regardless of others, because at the end of the day, the one person I have to report to is myself, and it’s always the case that when I feel anxiety or unhappy about something I haven’t stayed true to myself. What does this mean? It means really following your heart, and not just convincing yourself that you are. It means not changing your style of dress, behavior, or personality to be better liked. It means dropping people from your life that make you feel crappy, and surrounding yourself with people that make you feel good. In terms of my running, it had lost its previous passion because I was running for everyone but myself. As soon as I left the team I gradually re-found the fulfillment that was lost. It’s a little contradictory, but I now run more than I ever have, and I love it.\n\n<strong>2)</strong> I learned that communication and honesty are always the best policy. It’s a good and a bad thing to have a very thin filter between my mind and my lips, but I figure that anyone who is offended by my thought content and style probably isn’t a good friend match anyway. I also appreciate people who are open and honest with me, who I perceive to be more “real.”\n\n<strong>3)</strong> I know that I score highly on this personality dimension called the “need to belong.” I am most fulfilled by connecting with people, by making them happy. If you want to make me really happy, make me a part of something you are doing, or come along with me in something I’m doing. If you want to hurt me, do something that alienates me, is dishonest, or manipulative. A few times of hurt, I can forgive and move on, but I know myself well, and there is a certain line of squirminess that people can cross when I feel the automatic necessity to make a social cut.\n\n<strong>4)</strong> Having someone to love was like this forbidden fruit, that once I lost it, not only was the rejection painful, I wanted it back and felt incomplete without it. I realized through this process that life is most fulfilling when you are whole in yourself, and having something like a relationship isn’t even necessary. It sucks that society sends a prominent message that being single is akin to being incomplete, and that you should want a relationship. I can’t say either way whether I will stumble upon this love thing again, but I am certain that I don’t need it to be happy, and that when and if it comes along, I’ll just know it. And I am of the mindset that I will not change, or feel like I need to, for anyone. And given the pressure from society, the media, it’s pretty common to evaluate the people that are currently in your life and try to pick the best one, and even potentially obsess or force something that isn’t there. DON’T DO IT! I feel like I will either know, it will happen naturally, and if I’m unaware of a potential interest, if the guy in interested enough, he will put in the energy. I’m a strong believer that if the guy doesn’t have the energy or balls to pursue me, he’s probably not interested enough in the first place. Bottom line is that friends are amazing. I will always be socially healthy when I pursue and feed good friendships.\n\n<strong>5)</strong> Be good to yourself. You won’t always be in good spirits, and you don’t always have to smile. I find it refreshing to be pissed now and then &gt;:P It’s OK to value or fall into your neutral and negative moments as it is your positive. It is in the days of high negative emotion that you need to be better to yourself. I even sometimes go as far as to view myself as another person, and make decisions about how to treat myself based on that. I felt crappy the other morning, so I went to the state park. I’m also a firm believer in doing what you want when you feel like it. I manage my time and work based on this principle… I write papers and do work when I am driven and motivated to, and in that context I am efficient and enjoy it. When I don’t feel like doing something, I stop. Yeah, sometimes things are due and you HAVE to force yourself to do it, and you might not want to. The key in this case is that if you “don’t feel like doing something” consistently enough over time, you probably shouldn’t be pursuing that thing, yo.\n\n<strong>Knowing Myself:</strong> So, after four+ years, on the journey from an old 17 to a young 22, I know myself pretty well. To be happy, I need moments of people, humor, moments alone, color, music, sweet and salty, and movement. I realize that I started this entry announcing a decision, and you’ve probably read this far hungry to find out what that decision is exactly. It is a far far future goal, based on an activity that energizes me in the present moment, that has been a passion of mine since I was a kid, but I’ve largely abandoned it since coming to college. It is very far from a desk job, puts me in a position of being self directed in my work, and being exposed constantly to creative output, color, music, and connecting with people. It fits well with my personality, emotional character, and motivational structure. It let’s me wake up with the sun, and engage in a daily routine that I find fulfilling, that I wouldn’t even consider work, but more just living. If you haven’t guessed by now, and can’t tell by now, I’m not going to tell you. It’s not technically a “set profession,” just a theme really. You can ask me in person. I can tell you that it offers no clear path, not very high salaries, but that I’ve never felt so excited about something in my life, and I’m going to work really hard at it, and be the best that I can be. I’ve finally mustered the guts to follow my heart, and the feeling is full, beautiful, and like the euphoric high after a run. It’s been scratching at my mental cat door for quite some time, gosh, took me long enough to remove the kitty blocker.\n\n:)', 'Fall Reflections', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '44-revision', '', '', '2010-06-05 17:44:28', '2010-06-05 21:44:28', '', 44, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=45', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(49, 1, '2010-06-05 17:44:36', '2010-06-05 21:44:36', 'For the first time in many years, I’ve decided to do something based on wanting to do it, as opposed to doing what others want me to do. I’ve been getting accustomed to pursuing what makes me happy on a daily basis, but for the longest time, unable to apply this thinking when considering the future. It’s taken years of being pulled and stretched to finally be able to do this. And for the first time in my life, I feel what I might call a solid future footing, or an inner peace that completes my sense of self or identity.\r\n\r\n<strong>A JOURNEY:</strong> I’ll describe the path that I’ve taken at Duke to come to this place. It’s been really hard. I’ve been anxious, sad, and confused at times, lost and then under and illusion of guidance. I came here not knowing much about myself other than I was talented at a lot of things, and needed to do a lot of exploration to figure out which talent might further, make me most happy. I’d say that the hardest thing about having what motivational psychologists call a “need for cognition” in the domain of the self, and then being a pretty competent person in many skills is that at some point, breadth must turn to depth. What we commonly forget is that there is a difference between being good at something and being electrified by something. We commonly take a liking to things we are good at because it gives us a high feeling of self efficacy, but it may not define us. Then when we are good at something, and others regard it highly, we force ourselves into areas for the wrong reasons. Hello midlife crisis, or if you never get the insight followed by guts to be true to yourself, consistent unhappiness.\r\n\r\nI discovered early on that I was fascinated by people and behavior, and after stomping around in the econ/ public policy puddle I finally made the choice to screw everything else and just study psychology. I perceived this to be a dangerous choice at the time because it didn’t fall in line with any clear career line. As much as I loved the study, I knew (from working at a desk) that I would never be happy in a desk job, and that I just didn’t want to be a psychologist.\r\n\r\nCan’t select the right one? Get rid of the wrong ones. During my time at Duke, I’ve largely been trying things to see how much I like them. Sometimes, the easiest way to find what you like is to figure out what you don’t like. Here are some big things that I narrowed down.\r\n\r\n<strong>BIG THING #1:</strong> There is a lot of hoopla and press about this “research” thing. I mean oh my goodness, it’s what every good undergrad does… if you aren’t doing research in your chosen field then… FAIL! I tried research, twice actually, and ultimately went insane from working at a desk, and feeling forced to work in one flavor, with not enough creative outlet. It was… BORING! I also encountered many professors and students that think very highly of themselves. Heck, one even fashioned himself into a sort of brand. At first, I was impressed, maybe after talking with him/her once or twice. But what I realized, slowly over time, is that these people weren’t so fun or brilliant, they simply said the same things over and over again, and massaged their ego’s to some sort of intellectual orgasm. The more I encountered this type of person, the more I felt sick to my stomach, and sure that I never wanted to be like that. Moving on.\r\n\r\n<strong>BIG THING #2:</strong> The next “big thing” that every person at a place like Duke is forced to consider is what I might call this startup bug. It’s the sexiest thing to start your own business, and given the trend, it better have something to do with technology, something mobile, or something green. I had a lot of fun with this path, I must admit, but at the end of the day? My incentives and motives were completely based on the people I was working with… feeling like part of a team and having fun being united by the same goal. We could have been designing a new rubber-band or packaging turds, once the people component turned negative, so did the experience for me. I’m not against entrepreneurship… it is very much the path I will most likely be following maybe 15 years into the future, but it has to be in the right domain.\r\n\r\n<strong>BIG THING #3:</strong> Fall of senior year comes with a lot of “ohmygodI’mabouttograduateIneedaJOB” stress. Hello career fairs, e-recruiting, and submitting a lot of resumes to companies you aren’t sure what the hell you’d be doing. But why did I do it? Because obtaining a tangible job would give me guaranteed future success, stability, and look good to other people. Phew, right? No, not right. In the storm of anxiety I interviewed for consulting and research jobs, even did a case challenge competition, and attended every information session and panel that was available. It was in mid conversation with a partner from Deloitte when I realized, “wow, this guy is a douchebag. Being a consultant might make a lot of money, but when it comes down to it, it’s being a professional @ss kisser.” The thought of me being in that job role, again, made me sick to my stomach. I also went to a “women’s dessert event” and realized that I had absolutely nothing in common with these women, and found them a little boring, actually. Later consulting. It is a blessing in disguise that the one job at facebook that I DID interview for, I wasn’t offered. You can ask my friend Sam, before decisions were out, I was hoping that I wouldn’t get the offer to make the choice easier for me.\r\n\r\nThe social pressures of an institution can be distracting and sometimes louder than your internal voice. What happened is that this stream of exploding seniors made me forget that I would never be happy working at a desk. Once I remembered that (actually when I visited Palo Alto and saw all the little lemmings typety typety at their desks) I was quick to just cancel the rest of the desk jobs I was going to interview for. Doing so would be a waste of BOTH of our time.\r\n\r\nDon’t pidgeon hole your options for lame reasons: It was after this thought process that I realized that my squirminess with regards to my future wasn’t because I didn’t have something secured. I realized that, had I secured any of those jobs, the squirminess would have gotten worse. I realized that I was anxious and spending hours and hours mindlessly browsing easy opportunities, jobs, and graduate schools because I was severely limiting my options. The best thing for me, what my heart really wanted, I wasn’t even putting out there as an option. This is a disease of Duke… this feeling that, given I went to this school, I have to either get a REALLY GOOD job, pursue some form of graduate study (preferably in something sciencey, if you want to go for something like English or History - FAIL!) or go out and save the world, in a social or teaching sense.\r\n\r\nWe shuffle towards paths that are most accessible: I think that the majority of kids don’t really know what electrifies them, so it’s easy to latch on to options that are available, and seem do-able. A lot of graduate school (not all, mind you, but a lot) is probably pursued out of prolonging indecision, I think. It’s like, oh @#$%, I’m not really sure about what I want to do, but I can take these pre-reqs for med school, I can study for this test, and I know I can apply, hopefully get in somewhere, and then secure a future with financial and reputation-al prestige and security. I’m not saying that this is true for everyone - I’m sure that there are a group of kids out there that are electrified by the profession of medicine or law. I am just noticing a disproportionately large percentage of the student body that is enrolled along one of these courses, sometimes as a “last minute” decision, other times as a “well I declared it, and now I can’t take it back or people will think I suck,” or “heck, I’m not sure what else I’d do, this seems OK for now,” thing. Or maybe they really are convinced it’s their calling, and it might be. But once you jump on one of those wagons, Phew, your future is set, and it feels good now. If that’s the case, why aren’t people happier here? Time to make sacrifices now for that lofty future, because you might be happier then, right? On a tangent, we have this idea that given OK health, I am guaranteed a long life, and tomorrow is there. I’m of the mindset that the cancer patient is pretty much on par with you, me, no one is assured of longevity of life, the difference is having an idea about how much time you have left, and in that case, I could make an argument for wanting to be and not wanting to be the cancer patient. Anyway, back to the Duke undergrad. Okay, I’m pre-… med! law! If not that… graduate school! research! If not that… must… get…. job…. beyond that, can I really call myself a Duke graduate? I have this perception that given a certain income, title, or life-path, that will make me happy. Errrm, probably not. I think happiness is more of a personality trait that changes in degree with regards to the situation that you choose, but that’s another bucket of ladybugs.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of being true to yourself, Duke is a dangerous place. I would say that there is pressure, or even a disease, to be highly successful and achieving in the eyes of others. From the point of being accepted here to constantly being submurged in this murky pool of huge competition and academic aggogance, most of us develop (consciously or unconsciously) a feeling that, given I went to this school, I expect a certain salary, life outcome, certainty of success, once I am released. Also when you are here, if you didn’t already have it from high school, we further develop our fear of failure. I can’t tell you how many of my friends, who have the work ethic and drive to be successful, are terrified of not getting into graduate school, medical school, law school, or even getting a job or having some clear path after graduation. Heck, that’s been me this Fall. Hold up. First of all, there will always be opportunity for you given that you graduate college, let alone a brand name school like Duke. Wrong perspective. Too black and white. And if it isn’t just “out there,” then you make it. If you are unemployed for a year or go out and try something completely “crazy,” that’s OK.

a wheel?\r\n\r\n<strong>Convenience Eating up Experience:\r\n</strong>A lot of little things in life that are “easier” or “more convenient,” that mentally seem light a great idea, might actually eat away at life experience.  For example, I would call the Duke buses an incentive barrier from walking through the gardens, or possibly biking or trotting over to central or west campus.  When you either are forced to or force yourself to do it, and it isn’t a regular part of your life, it’s usually a very beautiful walk.  But since the buses are - there - and the most logical way to get from point A to point B, the other options don’t even come to mind.  And how can a busy student justify taking extra time to not be productive and just… walk?\r\n\r\nWhen I come back to my apartment and my laptop is open the ease of connectivity or “communicate” with people online makes the alternative not happen.  How about having a computer, and internet/email, period?  Take that ease a step further with an iphone.  It’s so easy, but is it better?  When is the last time you wrote a paper letter, delivered it in person, or went to visit a friend to talk over email or AIM (which, thanks to gmail, are one and the same).  Remember life when we didn’t have this technology?  Is it better now?\r\n\r\n<strong>What do I learn from this?\r\n</strong>Whenever I feel a strong desire to not do something, or a stronger one to engage in a behavior, I ask myself why, and if the reason doesn’t make me squirmy (like no, I’m not going to walk through the gardens at 2:00 in the morning alone, I’d bring a friend to feel more secure) then I might think if there are other ways to “accomplish” the same thing.  Then I might pick one of the other alternatives, just to try it out, and compare experience and not “rationality.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Opportunity:</strong> An opportunity is like a leak, or a hole in the fabric of your everyday environment that lets you engage in behavior that might have been harder to do before.  Essentially, it is the lowering of a barrier.  This is why an open door might be more of an invitation to robbery than a closed one, a dinner date or night out only happens when the invitation or car ride is presented to you, and reading an inspiring book or getting an email about an internship, project, etc, motivates you to engage in it.  All of these things are arguably always available to us, but when it is up to us to provide both the thought of doing it, the catalyst, and then the follow through, it’s a lot harder.  This is probably why in friend and even work groups you have your “thinkers,” that propose or present the idea, your “engage-ers” that keep the catalyst going until the reaction starts, and then the “do-ers” that jump in, keep the party going and are the ingredients to the entire recipe of experience.\r\n\r\nAnd here are some “decisions” that I mad that were largely reactions to my environment.\r\nDropped contact lens –&gt; decided that it was a good time to open a new pair\r\nmy legs hurt –&gt; time for new shoes\r\nhave to go to bathroom –&gt; decide to pack up and leave library\r\nThe same goes for moods - someone smiling at me makes me smile –&gt; I feel happy, and then I might attribute it to a choice or something i consciously did.\r\nI have a mental list of these - I’ll hold back from being a dork and including them all, you get the idea!!\r\n\r\nThe important takeaway is that you might identify and tweak tiny barriers to alter your behavior.  And just as there are BARRIERS, there are also TRIGGERS.  So create barriers for things you don’t want in your life, because they make you experience what my Dad likes to call a “suckfest,” and knock them down for things that might make you smile.  And I think that enough crappy stuff will happen “naturally” to provide that valuable contrast of experience, but it’s OK to be a little selfish and want encourage a life made of more positive puzzle pieces.\r\n\r\nFor my own life?  After making all these observations, and realizing how prominent environment is on everyday behavior, I can imagine that when I make any grand or minuscule choice, I will think hugely about the environment and how I might interact with it on a daily basis.  I’ll never take a “dream job” in a nasty city without those running and bike paths, and I’ll cut suckfesters from my life that make me feel crappy.  I’ve gotten ahead of myself in mentioning people - you might apply this idea of environment affecting behavior to people as well.  People that you choose (or like) to be around have a ginormous impact on your behavior, and consequently, how you view and feel about yourself.  For another time', 'Incentive Barriers', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'incentive-barriers', '', '', '2010-06-05 17:49:10', '2010-06-05 21:49:10', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=50', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Treatment might be more about best managing that time, maybe accelerating it with psychotherapy, or encouraging/facilitating connections with medication.

Here is a summation!\r\n\r\nMental disorder = change (in external environment (diathesis) that demands brain to adapt (reward system, stress, etc) at a speed that is TOO fast for the normal creation of neurons, wiring (pruning, growth, etc). Then we are encouraged to act in ways to protect this vulnerability and promote healing.\r\n\r\nDiathesis that demands change –&gt; inability to adapt (shock) –&gt; change in behavior cognition to promote healing\r\n\r\nor a simplified version…\r\n\r\n<strong>Change –&gt; brain as deer in headlights –&gt; Reaction\r\n</strong>\r\nWhat does this mean about our expectation of change?\r\nExpectation might be a good thing.  When we EXPECT change, that is almost giving our brains a heads up, to either start adapting early, be better prepared for the shock, or think of ways to avoid it.  Expectation can also be dangerous for disorders for which the brain might need a lot more time to heal.  For someone with schizophrenia, hope is lost after 1, 2, 5, 10 years, but what if that adaptation just takes a lot longer, yet we place some sort of time expectancy on it, and get our hopes up?  The same goes with depression, anxiety, mood, or body image disorder - when we create some sort of expectation around the timing of getting better, that can’t be great for treatment… We attribute a patient waking up from a long coma as a “miracle,” but suggests that our brains can heal, we just have no idea about the timing.  Isn’t it the same for mental illness?  Think of it as a spectrum of time needed to heal, something like coma on the far extreme right, something like a bad day on the less extreme left side… everything might fall somewhere along that spectrum.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean for how we view mental disorder?\r\nI’m not sure what to do with this idea, but I think that it has huge implications to change the way that we view mental disorder.  I am thinking that my idea can be taken from a public policy standpoint, it might be an idea that can be good because if “spread” it might change the way people think about mental illness and consequently how the mentally ill are treated, thought about, or it could take a more treatment-specific spin.\r\n\r\nIt could be woven into hypotheses about what the brain looks like “before and after” for specific disorders, or maybe something as simple as the brain’s response to getting hurt, and the timing of that response, and how its correlated with changes in thinking and behavior, and based on that timing, what are the best treatment options/implication for treatment?   Or the worlds of public policy and science might make some combined effort: start in the lab, get some results, and use those results to influence public’s perception/idea of mental illness.\r\n\r\nCan we err away from words like “crazy,” “psycho” and move towards something a little more sympathic, a little more human?  Falling and breaking your hand and going to see Dr. Handsy sure comes with a lot less negative stigma than talking with a “shrink.”  It’s just harder to look at any sort of maladaptive behavior in the same way as an injury gushing out blood and rocks.  What’s the difference?  We give a lot more value to pain that we can see, even though in both cases it is our body’s way of alerting us that something needs healing/adaptation.  The funny thing is that in both cases the experience of “crap, something is off” goes on in our heads.  At the same time it might make it very easy to “pretend,” and use that for manipulation, and knowing that leads to even more skepticism.  How do we distinguish the two?\r\n\r\nWhere does the negative stigma come to begin with?  Many behaviors of those with mental booboos are very noticeable and unacceptable in the eyes of society, and that lack of acceptance only serves to alienate those with mental illness even further.\r\n\r\n<strong>Final Point</strong> - Have compassion for the brain.\r\nGive your noggin a little more flexibility to get hurt, and have more acceptance when it does.  In essence, mental illness is less a negative thing, or something being “wrong” with the person, and more a brain booboo that needs time to heal.', 'Mental Disorder: The Mental Booboo Hypothesis', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mental-disorder-the-mental-booboo-hypothesis', '', '', '2010-06-05 17:51:09', '2010-06-05 21:51:09', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=52', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Then we are encouraged to act in ways to protect this vulnerability and promote healing.\n\nDiathesis that demands change –&gt; inability to adapt (shock) –&gt; change in behavior cognition to promote healing\n\nor a simplified version…\n\nChange –&gt; brain as deer in headlights –&gt; Reaction\n\nWhat does this mean about our expectation of change?\nExpectation might be a good thing.  When we EXPECT change, that is almost giving our brains a heads up, to either start adapting early, be better prepared for the shock, or think of ways to avoid it.  Expectation can also be dangerous for disorders for which the brain might need a lot more time to heal.  For someone with schizophrenia, hope is lost after 1, 2, 5, 10 years, but what if that adaptation just takes a lot longer, yet we place some sort of time expectancy on it, and get our hopes up?  The same goes with depression, anxiety, mood, or body image disorder - when we create some sort of expectation around the timing of getting better, that can’t be great for treatment… We attribute a patient waking up from a long coma as a “miracle,” but suggests that our brains can heal, we just have no idea about the timing.  Isn’t it the same for mental illness?  Think of it as a spectrum of time needed to heal, something like coma on the far extreme right, something like a bad day on the less extreme left side… everything might fall somewhere along that spectrum.\n\nWhat does this mean for how we view mental disorder?\nI’m not sure what to do with this idea, but I think that it has huge implications to change the way that we view mental disorder.  I am thinking that my idea can be taken from a public policy standpoint, it might be an idea that can be good because if “spread” it might change the way people think about mental illness and consequently how the mentally ill are treated, thought about, or it could take a more treatment-specific spin.\n\nIt could be woven into hypotheses about what the brain looks like “before and after” for specific disorders, or maybe something as simple as the brain’s response to getting hurt, and the timing of that response, and how its correlated with changes in thinking and behavior, and based on that timing, what are the best treatment options/implication for treatment?   Or the worlds of public policy and science might make some combined effort: start in the lab, get some results, and use those results to influence public’s perception/idea of mental illness.\n\nCan we err away from words like “crazy,” “psycho” and move towards something a little more sympathic, a little more human?  Falling and breaking your hand and going to see Dr. Handsy sure comes with a lot less negative stigma than talking with a “shrink.”  It’s just harder to look at any sort of maladaptive behavior in the same way as an injury gushing out blood and rocks.  What’s the difference?  We give a lot more value to pain that we can see, even though in both cases it is our body’s way of alerting us that something needs healing/adaptation.  The funny thing is that in both cases the experience of “crap, something is off” goes on in our heads.  At the same time it might make it very easy to “pretend,” and use that for manipulation, and knowing that leads to even more skepticism.  How do we distinguish the two?\n\nWhere does the negative stigma come to begin with?  Many behaviors of those with mental booboos are very noticeable and unacceptable in the eyes of society, and that lack of acceptance only serves to alienate those with mental illness even further.\n\nFinal Point - Have compassion for the brain.\nGive your noggin a little more flexibility to get hurt, and have more acceptance when it does.  In essence, mental illness is less a negative thing, or something being “wrong” with the person, and more a brain booboo that needs time to heal.', 'Mental Disorder: The Mental Booboo Hypothesis', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '52-revision', '', '', '2010-06-05 17:50:17', '2010-06-05 21:50:17', '', 52, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=53', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I started to chunk information into broad categories, and make connections between those categories.  The idea is that finding connections gives your paper it’s 1) theme(s) and 2) organization/flow.  While I was rambling, certain questions might have popped into my mind, and I would write them down, because investigating them might also lead to the foundation for a paper.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the step of clumping ideas together and starting to answer the question “what am I writing about anyway, what am i arguing?”  If you look at this document there is an idea of an “outline” at the top, and then highlighted yellow categories that might be a good order for that outline.  So I essentially said “what is my story?” and then “how am I going to tell it?”  But if you go beyond the yellow clumps… it’s just TEXT TEXT TEXT!  That’s the ramblings.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the hardest part in writing a paper, when you have a general idea and know what you want to write about, you have some evidence, but no clue in hell-o how to put it all together.  The way that I deal with this is by taking those broad yellow categories, (which are each important!) and thinking about how I might connect them.  So even before tackling any paper meat, I write some potential transitions, and you’ll see those under the yellow sections.  I’ve identified some idea buckets, and I’m just trying to loosely tie some of them together.  The next step is organization of the mass of paragraphs and ideas.\r\n\r\n<strong>STEP 3: Put Rambles in Idea Buckets\r\n</strong>3)  It’s going through those broad clumps of ideas, and just plopping them in an order and box that makes sense.  So in this step, I’m pairing the plot of the story with what might actually happen.  This is when I put “what I want to say” broadly “where I want to say it”  While I’m doing this I’m refining connections, maybe deciding that one category isn’t in the right spot, and also writing spur of the moment… new ideas even come to me and i say AHA, this needs to be added, and most of the time I even refine my thesis with these new ideas.  I say thesis, you ask, where did that come from?  I feel that the thesis comes to you as you are making connections, and grows with the paper.  For me, it started with something like (the movie ties schizophrenia to brilliance) then I thought about how it shows John as being in control of his treatment, how environment, stress, came into play, and thinking about those things in relation to the paper prompt - the thesis just emerges, really, I couldn’t tell you when… I think it comes early like a bud and matures with the thinking.\r\n\r\nIn terms of actual process, I literally draw a bold line below my yellow outline, above the mass of words, and start cutting from below and pasting above.  When the space below the line is empty, I’m done with this step.  You’ll also notice stuff in red, which is either instructions or notes to myself, to remember for the next step.\r\n\r\n<strong>STEP 4: Paperize It!\r\n</strong>4) The next part is easier.  The organization, transitions (flow of ideas) is basically done, now you have to prune and refine.  Yes, you have to actually… write the paper! (because a lot of the result of step 3 is just organized ramblings, it isn’t actually paper quality).  So I tackle one yellow section at a time, and do the same writing/copy/pasting combo again, but more on a detail level.  Now I care how the idea is said, (word choice, sentence structure), having the RIGHT transitions, topic sentences… ALL the details basically.  I also check the balance of the introduction and the conclusion, and make sure that everything that’s in the paper is found there.  The introduction should provide just the right amount to set up the story but not give everything away, and the conclusion has a little extra oomph at the end to leave the reader satisfied, but possibly create an appetite to ask more questions.  So in this step there will also be a lot of deletion (why it went from 12 single spaced to 8 double spaced pages, sans references and title page).  Historically (since maybe 2nd grade), my problem has never been “meeting the page requirement” and needing to write more, I have always been presented with the problem of cutting out what I don’t need.  Dude, just look at my blog, you know this about me   I only prune when I have to - like for work or academic things, because getting a point across quickly and directly is important!  But not for free writing.\r\n\r\nWhen you are sifting through evidence, the decision to include or not is more than just asking “is it good?”  I ask, given the context of what I’m trying to prove or say, does it add nothing? too little? or maybe I’ve already hammered the point, and have enough.\r\n\r\nAs I finish writing each yellow section, I’ll make it double spaced so it actually LOOKS like a paper.  That’s like my little reward for finishing a section\r\n\r\nSo now I have a first draft.  WOOT!! I’ll give it a day to steep, read it over, and make little corrections like I’m reading someone else’s paper.  This is also the stage when anyone else might see it, if I want feedback.  As my family knows, I usually send it to them, to look for the mispellings and commas that I missed.  Honestly, at this point I get lazy and feel like the cost of marginal work outweighs the benefits.  Largely, I don’t seek other people reading it.  So I do the minimum to “finalize” it.  I’m glad my family, if they get back to me with anything more than a “woo!!” is pretty chill about editing, otherwise I’d have to do more work.\r\n\r\n<strong>STEP 5: Make pretty, and print</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>I just fixed little things, added the citations and correct formatting (title page, references, page numbers), and I’m done.  yay.  The best part is emailing a copy to, myself, to print via e-print when I need it.  Shaaweet!\r\n\r\nHow does that compare to what you do?

Case in point? My trip to the storage place.\r\n\r\nThe woman that helped me was pretty nice, and her slowness didn’t bother me so much. I enjoyed the time standing at the counter and admiring the details of the characters on my lanyard, and looked for similarities between the shapes of my keys. I went to move my small load of things into my 5 X 10 sweetspot, and came back to find the couple that was waiting behind me arguing over a charge of 20 bucks. I was aware of the online discount, but didn’t think that it was worth troubling a perfectly good customer/salesperson relationship by complaining, having to re-do the transaction, can we think about it like opportunity cost of time? Opportunity cost of relationships? Opportunity cost of an ulcer? At what dollar amount do I care to say something?\r\n\r\nI think the difference is that I looked at her as another human being and not someone that was there to give me what I wanted. I felt grateful for her giving me the opportunity to slow down for a few moments, and observe something that I hadn’t given attention before. I was grateful for her kindness. I could have easily looked at the entire situation from another viewpoint - a negative one - “how slow she was! And she forgot my discount!” The couple wound up storming out to go to another storage place, arguing with each other, and I said “I hope your day looks up, it’s pretty nice outside… bye!” and returned to my car. I wonder how the rest of the couple’s day went? Did they find a storage spot, and if so, was it worth it? Money wise? Mood wise? Time wise? Did they potentially just close the door for returning to that place… is playing the role of the angry customer even worth it?\r\n\r\nThe question I really want to ask has to do with manipulation… and using leverage and other manipulative strategies, maybe some passive agressive-ness, to get what you want. In a nutshell, it’s using people. I know a handful of people that get by with this strategy, and I find that when they ask me for something, the normal rewarding feeling that I get when helping someone that I care about just isn’t there. In a few of the cases, I can tell a relationship isn’t balanced, and my kindness is being taken advantage of, just by that feeling.\r\n\r\nIs this idea of networking any different? No matter what you call it, I can’t stand it. At the end of the day, the item may be obtained, the money may be saved, you may get what you desire at the use or abuse or guilt of someone else, but it’s such a dirty game, and I can’t imagine the manipulator will have many friends in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we were in the same situation, but we acted upon it differently and as a result, wound up with two completely different outcomes and states of mind. Interesting.\r\n\r\nTime as color, time as music, it''s your choice\r\nMy friend commented that “wow, I get up early on Saturday” and my first thought was that Saturday isn’t different from any other day, really… I got tired at around 9:30 and was snoring by 10:00, and I woke up when I did. Should I have treated that section of my life differently because it was labeled as a Saturday?\r\n\r\nSo then I was questioning our labeling of time, and how that affects how we think about it. When during the week do people tend to be most happy, and is it related to the day? Are weekends really better or more relaxed as we might perceive them to be? Am I allowed to make my own labeling of time, so on a superficial level, change the labeling of the days of the week to maybe something that I associate for each day, like count time based on color, so Monday becomes Blue Day, Tuesday is GreenDay (haha, did somebody say Longview?), Wednesday Yellowday, and so on, or perhaps mileage, so each day becomes a number, only to be determined after I’ve run, or maybe each day can be named after a person, and on those particular days I am cognizant of doing things to show inward or outward appreciation for said person… and as my relationships change, so do my labels. Creating labels like this might force us to choose preferences, and keep them up to date. Might I label each day based on what TV show I watch at night, or what cereal I might like to eat for breakfast? Should I mix in some less desirable options to create contrast, or just limit the experience to my top 7? I do believe that “7″ is the agreed upon number for items that we can place in working memory - should we scratch that and challenge our brains to start working on 8, or go in the other direction and simplify “weeks” into groups of 3 X 24 hour periods?\r\n\r\nIn terms of controlling time, I let my biological clock do all the work. I haven’t set an alarm since early high school because my body just likes to wake up and start things going pretty early. I’m starting to like that less and less as I hear my peers going on about sleep and sleeping until… ten? noon? I would be in awe to make it to 8:00, 7:00 is possible though. My “problem” is more about indulging in managing my time, but when I say managing, I don’t mean planning in advance, just doing a lot at once. In a nutshell, I find organizing and layering it to be very fulfilling. This morning, for example, by 9:00 I had studied a bit, written some emails, done laundry, showered and dressed, errand to Target (to get a present for my apartment-mate, because she’s the best ever :) ), and I was driving to Uncle Bob’s storage with a partially loaded car to start the move-out process. Most mornings I’ve run and showered and am on the go by 8:00. It’s not that I wake up and say “OK, I’m going to do X, Y, then back to X.” it’s more of a I wake up, want to do X, when I’m finishing up X I am moved and motivated (and maybe there is external incentive?) to do Y, and Y leads naturally into Z. I hate planning, and obligations in advance, actually. Looking at my Google calendar, empty space makes me very happy, and having to be somewhere at a specific time, although I’ll be there, I find someone telling me that I have to be there less enjoyable then just figuring it out myself.\r\n\r\nNow I’m sure that I’ll appreciate this quality in the real world, but I’m envious of all you night owls, at the moment. It also makes me feel very isolated, almost in a sesame street way like, “one of these things is not like the other,” in terms of being a college student. Most “fun” and what-have-you doesn’t start until after 11:00, and that’s when I turn into a pumpkin. I wonder if there are other pumpkins out there, there must be! I would speculate everyone takes on some pumpkinality at a later stage in life, and maybe my midnight just came a bit sooner.\r\n\r\nAnyway, might it be fun or a learning experience to categorize and organize time in a different manner?

(64, 1, '2008-07-26 18:18:06', '2008-07-26 22:18:06', 'I had an epiphany two nights ago, that almost sent me into whoops, and it was simple. The idea can be articulated broadly, but at the moment I applied it to relationships.\r\n\r\nI don’t have to get married, ever. And before you make conclusions and analysis about this, let me explain, because I recognize that’s a pretty dramatic statement to just throw out there. You see, our society places a huge expectation on marriage, and it is generally assumed (by most) that at some point in his/her life there will be wedding bells and the like, when love is found. Society also creates an expectation of relationship, and through movies, TV shows, music, and the general media, glorifies and idealizes the experience of being in love, and the focus of having a boyfriend/girlfriend/significant other as part of a high quality life. And in this focus, most importantly, it makes individuals that don’t have that, in the present moment, somehow feel inadequate. I’m not saying that every single person feels inadequate, but I would speculate that the general mindset of the single person is to look for another half, whether proactively or not.\r\n\r\nI think this idea was pretty subconscious for me, just in the fact that I always assumed marriage, and that the cognition of never getting married, or never wanting/needing to, never surfaced… or let’s think about it differently: completely remove any preference and just think about it like not being aware of one’s relationship status. Even before I had any experience with romantic relationship, I assumed it charging down the track towards me. Can a life be valuable without the societal structure of a marriage? Maybe, maybe not, I’ve never thought about it, I don’t know. It’s less about the answer, (because I don’t think that there is one) and more about the thought itself.\r\n\r\nWhat this assumption of couple-ness did for me, was make me slightly blind to the goodness of my reality. I would go even further to say that it affected the way that I viewed myself. I focused too much on what the opposite sex might think of me, how they might judge my style, my choices and thoughts. It’s not that thinking about this isn’t normal, but I think that the assumption or desire for relationship can make the levels off balance, tint our behavior and decisions, and not always in our favor. It can make us tilt towards cognitions that are more questioning and uncertain and away from ones that are more like “this interaction/thing/person is AWESOME.” Again, the focus is about valuing and enjoying what “is” as opposed to what should (and if you are an optimist probably will be) and then we convince ourselves that the “happening-of” that future moment is contingent upon our awareness of it in the present. It’s largely not, and both experiences are best enjoyed when they are actually happening.\r\nMy friend and I talked about these two different experiences like baskets. Each one has its own flavorful, wonderful fruit, each to be enjoyed when the time is upon you, when its right. You run into trouble when you are sitting in one basket, and are focused or thinking about or subconsciously convinced that the fruit in the other basket might be better, and as a consequence you don’t fully appreciate the flavors in the basket that you are sitting in.\r\n\r\nBack to me. I exist day-to-day, relishing in things like my endorphined-out runs, coming home after a busy day to my explosion of color where I sleep, and beautiful moments of solitariness when I can sit in my pajamas and lick peanut butter off my fingers and laugh out loud watching Scrubs. I can largely spend my time as I please, work when I feel like it, have moments of altruism, selfishness, social fireworks, and calming silence. I guess the realization came to me that life, today, right now, as I’m writing this, in my present state, is really great, but it’s hard to be aware of that.\r\n\r\nSo it’s not that I don’t think the fruits in the other basket might taste really great, and I do find it rewarding to indulge my frontal lobe in imagining their succulence, but my main focus should be where I’m sitting. And there isn’t any point in trying to compare the fruits. Think about a thought like running into an interesting person, reading a funny comic, or stepping on a rock tomorrow. It’s not something that we have expectations about, but when it happens, we react to it. The same is true for love, careers, and all that. So when I say “I don’t have to get married,” that doesn’t imply a decision of shunning holy matrimony, now, at the ever-wise and omniscient age of 21 (note *sarcasm*). It implies letting it happen, if and when it does. This thought, in its meaning, in its simplicity, is incredibly powerful.\r\n\r\nSo enjoy it when it comes, but before it does, enjoy the now. Apply that to any domain of life, but it’s best done broadly, I think. Deterring part of your focus to the expectation is like putting a clothes pin on your nostrils as you sit in your basket and munch away at your fruit. Becoming aware of the quality of your life right now is like ridding your nose of that pin, and tasting the present. All of a sudden the ambiguous, unidentifiable fruit explodes in robust tanginess and mysterious sweetness. If you don’t taste your present fruit adequately you may (obviously) never fully enjoy the flavor, or react and jump up and down and discover that you can make juice or wine, and then in reaction to its flavor, lob it at someone passing by so they can try it too.\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time, how the fruit in the other basket might taste, or how we are told it will taste, doesn’t even matter.', ' "Is" tastes a lot sweeter than "will be"', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'is-tastes-a-lot-sweeter-than-will-be', '', '', '2010-06-05 17:58:49', '2010-06-05 21:58:49', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=64', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Although everyone has a little bit of when, then, and now in them (just like how Mini Me suggested in Austin Powers that everyone should try having a little mini in them) I would speculate that specific individuals might err stronger in one type than another. For simplicity’s sake, let’s place each type into one body. Let’s call our future oriented folk the “whens,” our past-focused-people the “thens” and our presently living patriots the “nows.”\r\n\r\nHow do we measure our characters? I am creating these hypothetical groups based on activity in the reward system (hypothalamus?). When I say present versus future versus past oriented, I am thinking about preferences, and measuring the activity in the reward system when either engaging in something in the present, thinking about engaging in it, or remembering engaging in it. I hypothesize that someone who would classify him or herself as more future/goal oriented or a “planner” might have the greatest activity in their reward center when thinking about something in the future as opposed to remembering doing it or actually doing it in the present.\r\n\r\nLet’s call this measure of reward or happiness “woo” points, which is currency I made up in a previous entry. Again, it’s probably not about comparing and finding averages of woo points between individuals, but about looking at the difference between levels within the individual. Person A and Person B might be in completely different galaxies with regard to the scale of their woo points, but have comparable proportions and consequently have similar preferences.\r\n\r\nLet’s use our characters to talk about time perception and valuation. How do we think about time? In different ways, I suspect, depending on your reward system and ability to make decisions. How much do we perceive to be in control of our time, and how valid is this belief? I think we all have different units in which we think about time. For me, life exists in daily cycles, and I must milk each day for all that it’s worth. When I run today I have no care for how hard my running today will affect my tomorrow. Perhaps I can change that to 24 hour cycles, because when I goto sleep I do count 6 or 7 fingers to see when my body is going to open its eyes, and what time that is relative to the start of class, when something opens, or when the sun rises. When I have had a completely awful day or am overly hard on myself, I am comforted by the fact that life almost resets when I goto sleep and wake up the next morning. I get another chance when darkness fades, to feel better or do right what seemed so wrong, and its usually the case that I wake up and my big wrong of the previous day seems sort of silly, or that I gave it much more attention than it deserved. But at this point, the wrong is in the past, and I like to think about the future. Let’s talk about our “whens.”\r\n\r\n<strong>The Whens\r\n</strong>The whens indulge in thinking about what might be, and create goals and plans to lead up to those moments. Whens use the past as an experience of lessons, and correlate actions with consequences in an effort to learn to prevent or exacerbate those outcomes. Action and dreaming are done, of course, in the ephemeral present, combined with distraction when a break is needed. How might we apply some scale to the future? There is the near future and the far future, and whens live in both. The present can be a double edged sword because a when might be doing something to increase or work towards far future options, but making choices on a daily basis prunes near future options.\r\n\r\nOur whens really like these options, and for things to be open and free. Possibly narrowing down options or taking out choices of things that “might be” could be distressing, and lead to indecisiveness in the present. Deciding upon X or Y is really hard, because if we choose X then we can’t indulge in thinking about the possibility of Y anymore. Matter of fact, in making decisions we decrease overall woo points, and are at a loss. Why? Because being able to dream about both X AND Y might have been more neurochemically rewarding than just X. But this isn’t to say that whens don’t know how to make choices about the future. When those choices are made, the focus simply zooms in, and becomes about the smaller pieces. If we are future oriented, narrowing down future choices might diminish present reward, and that is countered by breaking our decision into component or additional parts to think about. As long as some indulgence is there, the whens have their mental blankie, and it’s all good. But sometimes the dreamed goal could be coming on too fast, and in this case, time becomes an enemy.\r\n\r\nTime could be a hard thing for our whens. If you live in a future dream and are convinced that you must be X,Y,and Z within this constrained time to get to the moment you glamorize, you will certainly stress and worry and feel out of control of your time. Whens might set rigid ways in using their time that they deem to best become what they dream to be, and sacrifice present happiness for that future time, justify present discomfort or unhappiness with that future moment. This is when maladaptive beliefs are formed, and maintained, and they are largely unconscious. I think that these beliefs can be applied to any domain, and largely, have the same structure. A when might think something like “In order to achieve (this future outcome) I must (do this and sacrifice this) in the present” In strictly adhering to the “do this” part, our whens never try anything differently, and never learn that they might be able to accomplish the same things without sacrificing as much present happiness. On a larger scale, our whens never think about the idea that the future moment of fulfillment may never be realized, because it will always be just that, in the future. Even broader, in getting so consumed with this goal, the whens never introspect and figure out what really fulfills them, makes them happy, as human beings.\r\n\r\nBut putting a fork in this steam powered cycle would require one of two things. Either making the choice to marginally ease up on the rigid beliefs and see that the craved future is still there, yet present life is remarkably improved, or having something big and obvious happen that is like a red flag for our whens to stop, and look up. Hopefully, our whens learn that most of life, and wellbeing, is a choice, and that it is possible to maintain a beautiful future moment without sacrificing the present.\r\n\r\nThe when as…\r\n\r\n<strong>CONSUMER</strong> Let’s think about buying something. Whens buying patterns might be based on a future outlook. Other than the obvious “need” created by marketing/advertising, I think that a lot of purchasing is done based on the unconscious mindset that something available to me right now may not be available at some future point, or not conveniently available. For example, running shorts disguised as skirts are gaining popularity right now, and I’m a huge fan of feeling feminine while being able to escape at any moment. I was excited to think about buying a second black skort, because I reasoned that I wore it so frequently and loved it so much that having another one as backup, for security, made sense. However, before I made the purchase, the thought occurred to me that I didn’t need to prepare for the destruction of my current skirt. It just hadn’t occurred to me that when it happened, the likelihood of being able to get a very similar one, in that present moment, was very high, and that I didn’t currently need the second one. I didn’t buy the skirt. Interesting.\r\n<strong>\r\nROMANTIC</strong> In terms of relationships, if you’ve watched recent TED talks by Helen Fisher you might have noticed the relation to love as an addiction. For the whens, the addiction might be in thinking about the person, in thinking about a beautiful future with the face that we mentally crave. For these future oriented thinkers, when you remove the possibility in the present, that doesn’t eliminate the craving and need for those future moments. This is what leads to one type of heartbreak. But it also leads to a solid base for a long term relationship if the love is mutual. Another double edged sword, or maybe a rose bush metaphor fits better here.\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRISTMAS!!</strong> With regards to any planned event, like a holiday, for example, I would say that the whens get a lot more reward about thinking about the experience of the event as opposed to actually experiencing it. At least that is pretty consistent for me, but this might just be a result of overly magnificent expectations as I indulge in this future moment, and then disappointment when it turns out, as it usually does. But it’s hard to set expectations lower than what you’ve already experienced, so even when you don’t indulge in thinking about the future, it’s a lot harder to be surprised as we adapt to life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall:</strong> So I didn’t talk about our nows and thens, mostly because I find myself in an environment and culture of whens. I think that the structure of society serves to sort our “whens,” “thens,” and “nows.” if you are a when, you are very good at planning and preparing and acting with regard to the future, so you might do better in school. Thus, is it possible that the top universities are biased towards people that, overall, get more reward in thinking about the future? Could we run a test to determine if “quality” of the school in terms of how hard it is to get in somehow correlates with being future oriented? Then we can take a look at, Duke’s population for example, and break it down even further. Are the kids that enjoy partying, study and do work at the last minute, more present oriented? Are the kids that preoccupy themselves and even sacrifice present happiness for some future goal or moment more future oriented? Do we just throw everyone else that doesn’t plan or party compulsively into the “then” category?\r\n\r\n<strong>Why did I ask this question?</strong> My thinking about time began with a bathroom stall in Sanford. Not in intending to use it, but in (questionably) accidentally finding it. I entered the building after a long run with an itch to re-explore its intricate and confusing architecture of stairs, people pockets, and inappropriately placed swiveling chairs. It seems that after all these years it hasn’t been high on the priority list to replace the print-out bathroom door labels with anything other than an 8.5″ X 11,” (but at least they got an e-print!) so when I saw the one labeled “Women” on the second floor I figured I might ward off future discomfort by going now, since it was convenient.\r\n\r\nClosure is an elusive concept, and it is found in unexpected moments and ways. There are people and events in my life from which I still consciously hunger for closure, and ones that I don’t consciously think about, and then find it anyway. The second I stepped into this second floor bathroom the memory of a day in early February of 2007 flooded my memory. It was here that came after Pub Pol 55D with a pretty strange stomach ache that ultimately was catalyst for a surgery. This moment preceded huge physical and emotional pain, but I hadn’t known that, in that particular section of time. And it was amazing how quickly my mind placed me in that moment of discomfort, confusion, and uncertainty, and how, knowing what I presently knew, it was almost tragic to see my ignorant self about to cross into challenging times. Yet there was no thinking, analysis, or introspection beyond the memory of that feeling. Like the flick of a switch I conquered that moment. And in conquering that moment, I had conquered the entire experience. i had found closure, a feeling of peace and forgiveness towards the experience, almost like I looked the hairy beast from my past in the eyes, and did not avert my gaze. The moment was both powerful and humbling, and now the experience is best represented by the scar that it left. I am forever, visibly marked, but no longer vulnerable to the pain of the experience.\r\n\r\nThe way in which my brain rewinded to that moment, started my thinking about time. I realized that my mind also has the ability to fast forward to a future moment that I predict will be wonderful, in comparison to what precedes it. Standing on the line at races, or right before an exam, I can mentally fast forward to the time after the race, after the exam, and before I know it, I am there. With regards to a long run, I don’t think about the distance or “what is left,” but instead see myself at the next interesting marker along the way, and then I’m there. But you have to be careful not to fast forward the entirety of life. It’s like a story that I heard as a child of a boy that was given a magical string - tugging the string accelerated time… so when it was spring he wanted it to be fall, when it was fall he again wanted spring, so before long he pulled his entire life away.\r\n\r\nI am a “when” that struggles with the insight of a “now.” I don’t talk a lot about how I perceive life and death, and the uncertainty of it all, mostly because I don’t think telling someone about experience is enough to change their life outlook beyond a knowledge perspective. I can tell you that it made me question and challenge my every behavior and thinking, and figure out how to deal with the grinding between my more neurologically wired “when-ness” and forced epiphany of “now-ness.”\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that for everyone, everyday, regardless of what you believe or are told is the case, life is largely uncertain. Whether your life expectancy is eight or eighty years, both are on par, and you can’t use that expectation to dictate the now. But I love to indulge in my planning, my goals, and making things happen. The best way I’ve dealt with the conflict is to actively pursue balance. There is a certain tipping point when sacrificing present happiness for something in the future makes that future moment not worth it. (And no, I haven’t read that book, and I’m not sure how the author uses that phrase, although a friend is hopefully going to let me borrow it ) I’ve adjusted that point away from this glamorized future moment, because what we do have, to find beauty and fulfillment in, is the present moment, and the larger insight is that for most people that live for the future, well, can you actually get there, and if you do, will you feel how you expected? What keeps me balanced is taking the specificity and expectation out of where “I am going,” and just trusting that it’s going to be good. It allows for learning how to observe and be like those rare “nowers”, who do seem to know quite a lot', ' Now and later, but more later, really', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'now-and-later-but-more-later-really', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:00:55', '2010-06-05 22:00:55', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=66', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(68, 1, '2010-06-05 18:00:16', '2010-06-05 22:00:16', 'This is a story about the whens, the thens, and the nows. Although everyone has a little bit of when, then, and now in them (just like how Mini Me suggested in Austin Powers that everyone should try having a little mini in them) I would speculate that specific individuals might err stronger in one type than another. For simplicity’s sake, let’s place each type into one body. Let’s call our future oriented folk the “whens,” our past-focused-people the “thens” and our presently living patriots the “nows.”\n\nHow do we measure our characters? I am creating these hypothetical groups based on activity in the reward system (hypothalamus?). When I say present versus future versus past oriented, I am thinking about preferences, and measuring the activity in the reward system when either engaging in something in the present, thinking about engaging in it, or remembering engaging in it. I hypothesize that someone who would classify him or herself as more future/goal oriented or a “planner” might have the greatest activity in their reward center when thinking about something in the future as opposed to remembering doing it or actually doing it in the present.\n\nLet’s call this measure of reward or happiness “woo” points, which is currency I made up in a previous entry. Again, it’s probably not about comparing and finding averages of woo points between individuals, but about looking at the difference between levels within the individual. Person A and Person B might be in completely different galaxies with regard to the scale of their woo points, but have comparable proportions and consequently have similar preferences.\n\nLet’s use our characters to talk about time perception and valuation. How do we think about time? In different ways, I suspect, depending on your reward system and ability to make decisions. How much do we perceive to be in control of our time, and how valid is this belief? I think we all have different units in which we think about time. For me, life exists in daily cycles, and I must milk each day for all that it’s worth. When I run today I have no care for how hard my running today will affect my tomorrow. Perhaps I can change that to 24 hour cycles, because when I goto sleep I do count 6 or 7 fingers to see when my body is going to open its eyes, and what time that is relative to the start of class, when something opens, or when the sun rises. When I have had a completely awful day or am overly hard on myself, I am comforted by the fact that life almost resets when I goto sleep and wake up the next morning. I get another chance when darkness fades, to feel better or do right what seemed so wrong, and its usually the case that I wake up and my big wrong of the previous day seems sort of silly, or that I gave it much more attention than it deserved. But at this point, the wrong is in the past, and I like to think about the future. Let’s talk about our “whens.”\n\n<strong>The Whens\n</strong>The whens indulge in thinking about what might be, and create goals and plans to lead up to those moments. Whens use the past as an experience of lessons, and correlate actions with consequences in an effort to learn to prevent or exacerbate those outcomes. Action and dreaming are done, of course, in the ephemeral present, combined with distraction when a break is needed. How might we apply some scale to the future? There is the near future and the far future, and whens live in both. The present can be a double edged sword because a when might be doing something to increase or work towards far future options, but making choices on a daily basis prunes near future options.\n\nOur whens really like these options, and for things to be open and free. Possibly narrowing down options or taking out choices of things that “might be” could be distressing, and lead to indecisiveness in the present.

It’s about learning from it and discovering ways to have a better future.”</em> Laura King PhD University of Missouri\r\n\r\nI’m engrossed in a magazine, right now actually, and I read that quote, and felt like writing. At the beginning of writing this I wasn’t sure what I would be writing about, but after the fact I can tell you that this discussion is about relaxation, what it means, and different ways that we do, and don’t, relax.\r\n\r\nThis weekend as I was headed down to a conference in Florida, another opportunity I stumbled upon, I couldn’t help but realize that my incentive to go down and just have a fun weekend, see genetically-modified-orange-land and meet interesting people, didn’t feel that way anymore. I was exhausted from a presentation on the Friday, probably a few two many miles, and woke up in the middle of the night with a stummyache, looked in the mirror at very tired eyes, and the question spreading through my thoughts was “Can you sleep in? It sounds like such a beautiful idea… gosh Vanessa, you just flew vertically across the country LAST weekend, and next week you have an exam and many plans made, and at the end of the summer you are travelling to California, New Hampshire, and Baltimore in under 72 hours… and then the Fall semester starts on Monday. You look tired, yet you are thinking about this weekend trip, and your run in 5 hours. And you could, hypothetically, sleep in, but you won’t. Why can’t you just… slow down?” What the heck?”\r\n\r\nAnd there was no point in rationalizing it, but I tried anyway, and it was pretty lame, I think I grinned at myself, and then got distracted by making faces in the mirror. It happens But not to get side-tracked… I really don’t know how to relax, at least in big ways. I would argue that I allow myself marginal relaxation over time… closing my eyes on the bus, or lying in the sun, sitting on my bench enjoying my apple, walking through the gardens because I can… but I would call this active relaxing, more mental relaxing as opposed to physical relaxing. I think these two things largely come together, in varying levels… you could think of a Relaxation Gauge being composed of two parallel bars, one for physical relaxation and one for mental.\r\n\r\nComplete lack of physical and mental relaxation is probably a fight or flight response, and complete mental and physical relaxation is probably achieved through something like sleep or yoga (although I’m not a huge yogee)\r\n\r\nSo let’s talk about ways in which people relax. I think it’s safe to categorize relaxation into two types: physical and mental, and within those two types we can talk about external motivation to relax (going to your YOGA class, out to dinner with friends) and internal motivation (collapsing from being tired, getting an injury or sickness). When I put it in those terms, it feels like my own bias is coming in: I largely relax when other people give me incentive to, or when my body and/or mind just push the big red “ABORT” button, something happens so I don’t have a choice.\r\n\r\nIt’s like I keep moving at the same pace regardless of my responsibility, and if I slow down, I’m not sure what I would do with myself. I just don’t know how to do it… I’d jump on some new idea or project or at a minimum, a new something to watch accompanied by doing something creative all the while maintaining my connection with Gmail\r\n\r\nBut there is a difference between internal and external responsibilities. Keeping myself occupied with, watching LOST for example, has a certain amount of mindless enjoyment and is probably the extent of my ability to relax, coming just before sleep, which is just being unconscious right? That probably doesn’t count. Creating external business, like scheduling to leave for Florida 30 minutes after the end of a class presentation, arriving late at night, and then reporting to a University dressed in a black suit early the next morning for two days of scheduled meetings, then coming home at the last minute on Sunday to launch into another week of class and work, is different. It pretty much eliminates a lot of the potential for large scale physical and mental relaxation. Schedules do that, I think. I might still get my marginal relaxation in - like sitting on the floor at the airport and staring into nowhere, sleeping on the plane, and going to bed early, but are these tiny tastes enough to maintain a human being?\r\n\r\nAnd after recalling this weekends’ plans, I want to distinguish this busy-ness from stress, because that entire thing sounds pretty stressful. I organize things in a way that, at least from my perception, don’t feel stressful. Back to this weekend trip… all I had to do was walk 100 meters, get on the bus back to my apartment, and wait for my cab to come and drive me to the airport. So no, not a stressful weekend, not to say that stress and busyness don’t commonly go together, but less so for me.\r\n\r\nSo what does one do in the middle of the night with a delay in going back to sleep? I had a book on my bedside wire bookcase (Target special) under a bunch of inappropriately warm weathered New Hampshire hats, but books don’t talk back, so I woke up my laptop, and went to see which of my college friend crazies were still awake at the wee hours of the morning. Quite a few, actually. You crazies, go to sleep\r\n\r\nAs one of my special crazies and I chat about people, me mostly telling stories about interactions that I have found fulfilling, I kept my pondering of why I was questioning my “beautifully” planned out weekend on the back-burner. I know this weekend would have had many fulfilling and self-esteem/efficacy boosting components, but my reaction was still “eww.” Why, and how might I act on this cognition? Should I act at all? So I decided that if the ewey-ness lasted into the morning when I woke up again, since it was so novel and demanding attention, I should give it. It might be a strong sign that even if I don’t know how to do so, my body and mind want to slow down. That was pretty exciting to think, actually… step 1 in slowing down… unconscious desire brought into awareness to do it!\r\n\r\nSo I woke up, and it was still there, and almost as if forcing someone else’s hand to do the dialing, I called the airline, my hotel, the taxi service, and left a message with the company that no, I wouldn’t be there this weekend… but have a good one, Saturday is supposed to be beautiful. And in forcing myself to put a halt on these things, the cognitive squirminess started to grow, and I let it flow in an effort to understand it, maybe ask a lot of wrong and one or two right questions, and hopefully get some insight into why it’s so hard for me to slow down, to relax.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are. All that said, I’m still keeping myself busy with those less external responsibilities, but it’s definitely a step down from what I was originally scheduled to do. And I’m quote excited about my decision, actually, because it has started this new thought process, and I had a few small but incredibly fulfilling interactions that just wouldn’t have happened had I been on an airplane to Daytona Beach. And of course you could say the same about me being there are not here… the butterfly effect right? But that doesn’t matter, because I’m here and not there, but I do understand that we are inclined to look positively on the decisions we made, and at least neutrally about things that we passed over.\r\n\r\nIt all goes back to that idea of keeping in check with yourself, and taking self compassion to another level of applicability. Not when things go wrong, but when they go right too, knowing when it’s OK to say no to even something that might be really great because it throws you off balance. And speaking from this experience, I suspect that figuring out when you are going off balance is the hardest part.\r\n\r\nAnd here is where you might expect more conclusions, but I can’t comply. I know that I want to have a larger element of slowing down in my life, eventually, and that I will probably benefit from it, but I don’t know how to do it. I know that I’d love to dance, to be able to lie down into beautiful sleep without my body forcing me into it, and to not feel the need to be moving at the same, pretty hectic pace. Uhl. Where to start thinking?\r\n\r\nScheduling physical and or mental relaxation might work to slow down, but my historical data tells me that I won’t do that, at least just for myself.\r\n\r\nThe biggest force that has even given me any incentive to slow down has always been other people. Different levels of relationships slow me down to different degrees, for example friends provide relaxed dinners and going fun places and good conversation, I love my friends. But the frequency of this is pretty low, despite the high quality of the time. I might amass a gazillion little connections like these to slow me down, but I think that would be spreading one person too thin. I sort of enjoy the level that I have right now, it feels right.\r\n\r\nI’ve also been forced to slow down by injury and medical adversity, and although I wouldn’t omit those experiences from my life, they largely sucked, and I’m not looking to have any part of me opened up again. And getting injured is the ultimate emotional poo-fest, because running and feeling strong adds so much positive to my life.\r\n\r\nI don’t have any answers for myself, at the moment, beyond people. I’d be interested to know how other people relax, so maybe I can gain insight into myself. The ironic part, the surprising part, is that I’m quite happy being this way, I’m loving life at the moment, despite those tired eyes that look back at me pretty frequently. I think that my future oriented self is sort of hoping that the me in 5 years will have learned and changed and possibly be more insightful than the me of today. The incentive is out there for my life outlook to change drastically in terms of the speed that I move, think, and live, but I just haven’t found the catalyst yet. Perhaps I haven’t asked the right questions, or I haven’t figured out how to ask them, or found someone that influences me to do so. It’s sort of ambiguous, but I am confident that these things come with time.\r\n\r\nUntil that time, I have to listen to my gut, and keep checks on staying balanced. So onward - give the oxen adequate rations, continue the grueling pace, and let’s ford that approaching river and turn the ox cart into a boat.', ' Relaxation: Why is slowing down so hard?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'relaxation-why-is-slowing-down-so-hard', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:01:56', '2010-06-05 22:01:56', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=70', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It’s a couple of minutes to stop moving, to hear the satisfying crunch of teeth into the wet flesh of fruit, and relish the natural sweetness while quietly observing the motion of people around me. Will the apple crumble and fall on my shirt, and taste more like a pear? or have a more pristine, while texture that contrasts the red skin. Those sort of apples seem to have a thicker skin, so there is a slight delay between the moment when my teeth hit the surface to piercing through the papery shell.\r\n\r\nToday, I indulged in this moment, and allowed my senses to become hyper-aware of my surroundings. As I was carefully rotating the object of my affections and watching a group of middle aged Sunday Duke tourers pass by, I noticed an older gentleman grinning at me upon approach, continuing to stare, and upon realizing that I was uncomfortably aware of his attention towards me, he smilingly mumbled “fruit, eh?”\r\n\r\nAnd in my mind I first responded with sarcasm, “that’s right, an apple is fruit, you creepy potato chip,” but then my next mental response to him was “but it can’t just be any fruit.”\r\n\r\nIn this moment I was finishing up the consumption process, after taking care of all of the skin the flesh came next, and then the goal was to not miss the smallest piece, because that would be pretty wasteful. And then a particular face filled in my mind’s canvas. In that moment I realized that every time I sat down to have an apple, exactly at the end, I thought of you ,Stokes, how you carefully showed me many times at track meets or during lunch at school how so many people “finished” apples prematurely, leaving behind so many good bites on the core, and how you could actually eat the entire thing until it was this spindly string of a stem attached to some seeds. And how you had a particularly Stokish way of doing it, and how I love your Stokish ways. And every time that I have an apple, without failure, I think of you. My experience of eating an apple is completely intertwined with experience with you, and with our friendship. Every time I sit down to have this apple experience, I am spending time with my best friend, assuring myself a moment in the day for you, because when distance makes the real you impossible to be with, the mind is a powerful tool for bringing us together.\r\n\r\nSo here is an ode, to Stokes, and to apples, but if you listened carefully, you would see that it’s really not as much about the apples. I think that we live and breathe particular experiences and rituals to connect us to people and memories that we cherish, and keep a little of the past, or the currently unreachable, in the present. And to Stokes: although I can’t be sure of most things, I want you to know that you can always be assured of our friendship, and that you are important to me, I miss you, and will always be my iso!\r\n\r\n…and as soon as the apple is maximally consumed, and I make the decision to stand up, find the nearest trash can, and continue the motion of my day, all aspects of the experience end. But that’s not so bad, because I know that I will indulge in a similar moment the next day, but potentially with a new location, and certainly a new apple that won’t reveal itself until the first bite is taken, and most importantly, a quiet moment with my best friend.', 'To Stokes, and to Apples', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'to-stokes-and-to-apples', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:02:37', '2010-06-05 22:02:37', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=72', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This goes back to the idea that you can’t understand something if you aren’t familiar with it’s opposite - bad doesn’t have a lot of meaning without understanding good, hot without cold, etc. I can’t fully appreciate a great friend if I haven’t been treated poorly at some point. You can’t fully appreciate a state of good health because it’s impossible to be aware of things that are absent… you only are aware of how bad a stomach ache is…when you have one!\r\n\r\nTo fully understand any idea and experience the full spectrum of a certain concept you have to have life experience that sets the outer limits of your range of experience. I can imagine that these outer limits vary for different people.. for example, being from New Hampshire, my concept of cold might vary drastically from someone from Florida,.and I would suspect the same is true for hot, but the other way around. The way that we construe the present is a direct reflection of these levels and ranges of experience. So if I have a more complex or larger span of understanding something, it can be a double edged sword, depending in what direction most of your experience has fallen.\r\n\r\nIf I’ve had a lot of bad stuff happen to me, I might be more resilient when minor bad things happen, or at least have the mindset that “oh, this isn’t so bad…” as opposed to someone that lacks any adversity, and for that individual, the minor scrape can feel like a very traumatic event. On the other hand, I can see how extending your experience of amazing things might set a lot higher expectations and make it a lot harder to reach the upper parts of the range. You sort of have inflation of experience… it might take a lot more WOOO dollars (let’s call that the currency of enjoyment) to reach the same level of enjoyment, except the problem is that the WOO dollars that I am receiving from everyday experience remain the same, the cost of the same feeling is just a higher.\r\n\r\nSo what do we do? Raise the money supply right? Search for different experiences that might pay more WOO dollars to reach those upper limits. Maybe instead of trying to max out our range we should look for experiences with marginal benefit… just enough WOO dollars to go over the turning point from negative to positive experience and give us a “woohoo!” but not enough to change the scale. Okay enough poorly articulated Econ, and back to little, tangible things that can be thought about in everyday life.\r\n\r\nI’ve always been a big fan of trail mix, mostly because of the variety. My Dad has this super efficient “technique” of putting everything into his mouth at the same time, minimizing consumption time perhaps, but I’ve always been very particular about the experience of eating. Everything is enjoyed to its fullest potential in its simplest form, but ordered with other things - so I like to isolate flavors, eat one thing at a time, and sometimes combine two things that work well together. For example, when I was a kid I used to stick raisins in the holes of cracklin oat bran and stretch them out so they would swell like grapes, and change the texture, and the taste was amazing, and it was fun putting them together. So what does this have to do with the contrast of experience? You can really experience the wheatiness of the pretzel better if it follows something sweet like chocolate, and the flavor that you like to linger with you is best to be saved for last. I’m not saying that a single high quality item wouldn’t be enjoyed greatly, but even from a biological standpoint, don’t taste buds adapt to types of flavor, making the first bite the tastiest, and making a variety of flavors a more rich experience? Eating, like many life experiences, is filled with ritual, many that we aren’t even aware of. To take this into perspective and apply it to life experience… I think that we can appreciate or better enjoy individual experiences and people when we can put them in context or perspective of other ones. This is why relaxing and watching a movie might be enjoyed more following a day filled with work than a day filled with leisure. This might be why we sometimes don’t appreciate a person, or a room-mate, until we meet someone… so much worse! This might be why, even though we like routine as human beings, life can get boring without a little bit of change to ensure a spectrum of experience.\r\n\r\nI think that as humans we try to maximize the quality of our experience and look for consistent, habitual activities that seem to do that. Is it safe to say that we try and avoid things that might be labeled as unpleasant or bad? I think you only run into trouble when you don’t expose yourself to enough of the BAD, and too much of the good. And if you read Stumbling on Happiness or watched the TED talk by the author, you would see that regardless of what happens, we are inclined to view it in a way that feels good. It seems like a win-win situation. When something you perceive as “bad” happens, learning occurs that changes the scale of your experience, so minor bad things don’t seem as bad and little good things seem even better, and we are biologically inclined to look back on said yucky experience and still feel good. Maybe it’s best to do away with labels and expectations, and allow all forms of experience to flow in. Gosh, back to that balance thing!

These forms of expression might be verifying of our identity, relieve stress, provide fulfillment, or a combination of those things. Whatever they do for us, I think that everyone might have a preferred way of expression that, when they do it, time slips through their fingers like noodles slip off a spoon in soup. When engaged in other things, the musician might move his fingers to the movement of music, or chords on his guitar, or the artist might see an interesting object and have an intense desire to paint it.

For me, my preferred form of expression is writing… obviously, right? :) And layered with that is movement and music. What is surprising to me is how much of my life I’ve gone without this insight. So let’ s start off with some questions.\r\n\r\n* Is it valuable to know or think about how you like to express yourself? and\r\n* How do I go about figuring it out?\r\nAka, why should I care, and if I do care, what might I do if I’m not sure?\r\n\r\n<strong>Is it valuable to know or think about how you like to express yourself?\r\n</strong>I would say yes. Feeling like you know yourself intimately, have an idea of what is going on in your head, why you might think certain things or act in a certain way, just feels good. This is all bundled into the rubber-band ball of seeking insight. It’s also nice to know what sort of environments, people, and activities can both be a gas pump for our hearts and a recharger for our mental batteries. Maybe the danger of not knowing, and feeling disconnected and lacking fulfillment is reason enough to think about it. I also think that our preferred methods of expression are not static, and multifaceted, so when you think about it, you might go beyond the broad categories that I’ve mentioned. For example, I enjoy writing while listening to music, always on the computer (because I can’t physically write as fast as I think, and I find that frustrating), and I usually write when I am not with a group of people.) I also find myself speaking how I write sometimes, and one of the biggest reasons that I get lost in my runs is that I am writing in my head. But then you might ask, is it really the writing, or the thinking about certain ideas? Or is it the sharing of those ideas with other people? This is where the idea of expression expands. Possibly there is a core that I might label as “writing,” but all of those little appendages add additional value and make the entire experience more fulfilling for me. So expression isn’t a solitary, definable activity, it is a collection of experiences, maybe even tied to ritual.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I go about figuring it out?\r\n</strong>It’s easy… just have an epiphany, right? The gooey thing about finding insight into yourself is that I’m not sure how to explain it, predict it, other than to encourage asking questions about yourself, both action and thought. I think that insight comes both with choice and chance. First, with adversity… so a tower crumbles before your eyes and you are forced to deal with the wreckage and then figure out how to build a new one. Why did the first one fall? Should you build the same one again, or do it differently?\r\n\r\nWe could also make the choice to ask questions about our tower, before it falls or draws anyone’s attention (including our own) and this is a lot harder. On a daily basis this might be asking questions like “why do I enjoy this?

At Amherst, they do a better job of tending the soil, making sure that sunlight hits everyone’s pot, and clustering students in pots of just the right size. And there are no “special pots.” At Duke, everyone is put in a tiny pot, the soil is a little dry, and its up to us to migrate… and all around we see big pots that look really great from the outside, but a sign says “to grow here you must be X,Y,Z” So you get a bunch of little plants trying to satisfy the requirements of the “special” pots, which results in a lot of similar behavior and the sense of needing to meet certain standards. And in this rush, these buds forget to keep in check with their own sunlight, and soil.\r\n\r\nBut in getting a little thirsty, a little withered, or finally taking notice of what is directly around them, to survive, Duke pots must learn to take care of themselves. I’m not saying that this epiphany comes to everyone, but I think that adversity, or more challenging life experience, breeds greater wisdom and resilience. Timing varies, and some might never learn to take care of themselves, or never be aware of the soil they are growing in because the soil in the “special” pot looks so wonderful, but the challenge is the same for all of us. So in this light, a larger, more impersonal school might be that more challenging environment that allows us to grow as people, allows us to stumble upon self awareness. I have learned this recently myself, and am still surprised at how many people don’t seem to think about the idea of taking care of themselves.\r\n\r\nYou have to take care of yourself, because when it comes down to it, that’s what you have. If you don’t take care of yourself, it’s going to be very challenging to help others, and the idea of a deux ex machina swooping in and saving you is a lovely one, and stops there. It’s very common to point an inward finger of blame and criticism when something goes wrong, and add another layer of negativity to your situation, but do you need it there? I can also imagine being so used to having other people take care of you, that in absence of these people, you are rendered helpless. It all comes down to that idea of the balance of giving and taking energy. Not knowing how to take care of yourself and relying on others, you take too much, and not knowing how to take care of yourself and striving to impress others with hopes of filling your emptiness, you probably give too much.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of people that might not like you, that you might not get along with, and that’s OK. There are plenty of bad days, and things get messed up every once in a while. This means… *drumroll* that we are human. And something that seems obvious but is equally surprising is the idea that when you take care of yourself, other pots want to grow near you, and all of a sudden, you have a different perspective about those pots that seemed so special when you were just a bud.\r\n\r\nSo, might we be preparing for the real world? Without having solid roots and a sense of self, I think that it’s hard to grow at all. It is easy to think that most of what we need, what we want, is outside of our pots, and not with us in time and space. But if you look down, everything that you need is already there, you just have to really see it.', 'Duke and Amherst Pots: The Difference Between Small and Large Schools', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'duke-and-amherst-pots-the-difference-between-small-and-large-schools', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:05:54', '2010-06-05 22:05:54', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=80', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Yeah, one minute it''s cold, and then I''m sweating... and I feel like a little monster is living in my gut with a "make Vanessa feel nauseous" button and then a "make Vanessa feel achey" lever, but sitting here, in the moment, I''m quite content. There''s really nothing that awful about illness.\r\n\r\nI lucked out today in that my professor woke up with a migraine and canceled class, although I was already on main West and sitting through a class wouldn''t have been so bad. I passed out on some comfy chairs in the BC until the world had stopped spinning enough for me to drive back to my apartment, and then I got to sleep more.\r\n\r\nBut warm broth, when it finally stayed down, tasted really good, and there is something wonderful about lying in bed with sun rays coming in. I did some work, made the trek to fetch my finished laundry, and just sat down when a wave of anything came over me. I may have some nasty stomach virus, but given that I don''t need to move very much, that life is pleasant in the present moment, it feels more like an adventure, a deviation from the norm, than anything bad.\r\n\r\nSo why such a negative stigma? I think that sickness does have its awful moments, for example praising the porcelain goddess is an awful awful feeling. I think those bad moments are probably what stick with us when we recall being sick, and not the other 99% of the time when we were just, being, and being wasn''t so bad. I''m not saying that I would choose being chronically sick over good health, but like many things, I think that different experiences make life interesting, and that it just depends on how you choose to look at them.', 'The Wonderful Things about Being Sick', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-wonderful-things-about-being-sick', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:06:36', '2010-06-05 22:06:36', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=82', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I am usually inclined to fill it up to the top, or at least let the water run until it is moderately above the label. But then adding flavor to it, it becomes more diluted, and it’s has less room to mix. Personally, I enjoy the stronger flavor better, and don’t need the entire volume of the bottle to quench my thirst. And if I am just carrying around water? A half filled bottle is a lot lighter, and I can always add more. Enough with the rationalization - the main point is that many little things that we do in life have become so habitual that we pass over examination that trying something differently may be very rewarding.\r\n\r\nSo I’m not hammering down the overused phrase “variety is the spice of life!” and encouraging you to examine and tweak absolutely everything you do because it’s not OK to have ritual and habit. Those are good things, actually… when you’ve identified that you love something, and that it makes you happy, stick with it. I’m talking about little behaviors and habits that are done sans thought, like filling up a water bottle. I thought that more was always better, mostly because I never bothered to think that it might not be.\r\n\r\nHow can this apply to life? Think about what is customary, or expected, of a particular situation, identify what you value or makes you happiest about that situation, and maximize that, regardless of expectations or norms. Expectation isn’t what will necessarily make you happiest. The hard part, I think, is that a lot of these norms have become some engrained in us that we just do, and don’t think. Expectations ruin everything… my favorite line of my Introduction to Visual Culture class my first year at Duke. I can think of another domain for which expectations can make a good pair of teeth sort of fuzzy.\r\n\r\nHold the weather analogy, friendships are like fruit I used to have the expectation of a friendship being all encompassing - spending an enormous amount of time together, and doing everything from eating to running, moving watching to hanging out and conversation. You know, we’d have the matching key chains and complete each other’s sentences. Perhaps this expectation stems from the fact that I have had intense friendships like this. Friendships come in different varieties, like fruit. I never thought about the idea that it’s OK to have a friend that you run with (when I feel like an orange), a friend that you go out to eat with (sometimes I’m more in the mood for an apple), a friend that you chat with on the way to class (kumquat anyone?). Sometimes I’m more hungry for insightful discussion, and I know who to talk to for that. And sometimes I want to do absolutely nothing and laugh at “that’s what she said” jokes, and a certain fruit tastes really good when I crave that. The danger comes in having the expectation of an everlasting gobstopper, or that gum from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory that turned Violet into a blueberry. One person shouldn’t, really can’t, be every fruit. Too heavy an expectation would feel sucky if you or I couldn’t meet it, and might strain our friendship. And this doesn’t imply superficiality, which is how I used to think about it, it means that we interact with many types of people, get a nice variety of flavors, and life is rich. It allows both people room to give and take, time and energy, and I think that this allows people to surprise you, be there for you when you least expect it, and I find those moments of a friendship to be most fulfilling.', 'Little Things I thought About Today', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'little-things-i-thought-about-today', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:07:21', '2010-06-05 22:07:21', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=84', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(86, 1, '2008-06-14 09:06:25', '2008-06-14 13:06:25', 'On a daily basis, we do things to feel good about ourselves, to feel valuable as people. I can see some broad categories, all clustered into “relationships” and “work/getting shit done.” The relationship node can encompass any sort of interaction with other people, and I see the work node as any form of action in life that could render you “busy” or “productive” or basically not doing something (like sleep or relaxation) that might make you feel guilty for NOT working. Yes, unfortunately that seems to be a common guilt for my generation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, feeling value is largely a balance, we dip and get fed from both wells. I like to feel valued and good about myself by both social and academic accomplishments, both large and small. And when i say academic i mean “getting myself, or my cause, somewhere” not just school work. The main difference between these nodes lies in the level of perceived control.\r\n\r\nFor me, its a lot harder to predict, and be sure of, getting social fulfillment on a day to day basis, so I lean heavily on “getting shit done” to feel valued. Over time, this can become habitual, because it is certain. I am under control of what I get done, it is up to me. But anything that involves other people isn’t predictable like that… I can’t rely on it on a daily basis for feeling good… because even if I DO get fed from this social node, there is no guarantee that it will taste good, or satiate me at all.\r\n\r\nSo applying this further, to myself, if you look at my average day, it is “inhuman” (as my mom calls it, ty mom, I know I’m an alien, but methinks you might have something to do with that :P ) and productive to an extreme. How would someone else feel living a day of my life? Would it overwhelm someone else? I’m not sure… It’s a question I’ve always had about myself, and other people too. But I am leaning towards the idea that college is a “loaded” environment in this sense - and that my need for busy-ness will change as time and environment changes.\r\n\r\nThe important point is that feeding the work node keeps my valuation of myself at a steady level while other influences that aren’t under my control can come in. So on days that I get social boosts, the productiveness can go down a bit, and i still feel good. But I need the work node to be full on days when there is nothing. And of course long long spans of nothing aren’t good for me either, so I keep that in mind. But on the whole, other people aren’t in my control, and I just do what I can to be around other people, and it’s exciting when I get fed/feel good from a social interaction.\r\n\r\nI’m thinking about this now because I’ve had social situations that haven’t fed me, (it was more disappointing when I thought that it might and then didn’t), and I’ve been heavily leaning on the “work” dynamic and being busy and productive to feel good, but it’s been long enough that my stores are running low. And in this case I’m learning to be like one of my friends who is abroad for the summer, and be the catalyst to pull people together to do something fun, on occasion - I might send out an initial “poke” to some friends to go out to dinner, or invite them to tag along for a shopping trip, or something like that. I’m never sure what will come of it, but it’s usually really fun, and fulfilling, at least for me, so I think it will shift me back into balance.

I start to lose distance, but I’m still next to the bus. She speeds right by the next bus stop. Finally I’m in an all out sprint and the bus pulls ahead, I’m killing myself running behind the bus, probably a quarter mile total, all around the bus loop down the road and under the bridge from East campus. She’s not stopping. The likelihood that she DIDN’T see me and NO one else on the bus did and alert her, is pretty small, and she didn’t bother to stop for me at the next stop, where she is allowed to stop.

(97, 1, '2008-06-05 12:14:50', '2008-06-05 16:14:50', 'I have a good friend that I often share the finest details of my analysis of people, behavior, and the social world. I throw a huge, ugly spittooee of thinking at him, reach the limits of my analysis and then the fatal moment when I’ve analyzed everything, have a huge amount of information, no idea what to do with it, and then wait for him to wipe my cognizant sneeze off of his eyes, and then I ask, “well what should I do?” And he’s told me this many times before, it’s what I come to expect, but until recently I didn’t realize what good advice it was.\r\n\r\n“V, stop thinking”\r\n\r\n“!@$##@#$##!! (insert squirmy-ness here) that’s like telling me to stop breathing! it’s not… possible!” But when I… thought about it (haha) I realized what good advice this is when you think about relationships. I think that it is more appropriate for romantic and friendship type relationships and less so family, but here is my idea.\r\n\r\nA lot of college kids are frustrated by the absence of a deep relationships, whether that be friendship or romance, I’m sure it could be one or the other, both, or even vary by the day. In this frustration they (we) ask questions like “what is wrong with me, what is wrong with this environment so i don’t have what I think it is that I want, or deserve, and what do I have to do to get it?” Then we stumble back and forth between vows of pro-active behavior, bouts of self pity, and blaming. In the best times, I realize, I’m just distracted from thinking about it at all. Wait, in the best times I’m not thinking about it at all? So in whatever I am doing, I see a pattern of being most content when I’m not aware of my social-ness or lack of i it?? Rewind!\r\n\r\nSo how do we evaluate our relationships, how do we know where to put energy, where to hold back, and how do we evaluate ourselves as members of a social network? The answer is so much simpler than I thought possible - just relax and stop thinking about it. I know, it’s not the most satisfactory answer, but hear me out.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways you might be attracted to a person, and when I say attraction I am referring to those things that make someone else interesting, and ultimately compel us to engage them. When I think of an ideal friend, partner, running buddy, I’m pretty sure that my ideals aren’t founded on anything deeper than “well we share these interests, he’s a nice looking guy, he is similar to me,” etc. Those are really products of the retrospectoscope - us attempting to put a label on something after the fact that we probably don’t understand at all. I’m not even sure that I am capable of telling you what lets conversation flow comfortably and naturally between me and another person, or makes me want to spend time with them, and seek them out. What it comes down to is the idea that “good” relationships cannot be looked for, grown, forced, or predicted. We are going to put energy and time into people that we like to be around, that make us feel good, that we have a good dynamic with, really without thinking much about it. And if you stumble upon a two way street, you’ve probably hit gold. But in the most enduring (best?) relationships, no matter what the type, we get something out of interacting with the other person, and that positive something that we get lasts over time. And given that dynamics and people change, this something can also be lost, and that can lead to distress or despair, and confusion. But there isn’t much benefit of analyzing the black box that is this dynamic, trying to label incentives, track them, and do what I do way too much, over-think many of my relationships that aren’t the way I want them to be, and ask why.\r\n\r\nBecause you largely can’t answer that question, and more importantly, you don’t need to. The beautiful thing about this idea is the realization that it’s OK to not have yet found the other person, or other people, either friend or lover or confidant or running buddy, that might complement, complete, or fulfill you. Don’t jump to concussions, it doesn’t mean anything about you. But complete is a dangerous word, because with people, two incomplete people do not constitute a whole person. And this is exactly why it is best to focus on seeking personal fulfillment, whatever that means for you. And in pursuing what makes you happy, you will most certainly experience many types of relationships, learn from them, and hopefully find some rare sapphires.\r\n\r\nSo I started this thought by saying “just stop thinking,” but I think it’s important to still be aware- be aware of yourself, be aware of people that are directing energy toward you that you don’t know much about at all, aware of keeping in checks with dynamics that you do value, and be aware of the bases that found your relationships. This is another beautiful metaphor - the idea that friendships can be looked at like structures. Built on the wrong base, perhaps just for social purposes and lacking compassion and a connection with one another, is like trying to build a tower in a sand pit. Adding floors to that tower will be very challenging, as well as finding structural stability. This is an interesting conversation I had with another friend, actually about the dynamics of conversation. Look at trends in conversation over time, and ask if one person is simply filling in gaps with an occasional “cool, yeah, lol” when it is appropriate, and essentially adding nothing to the other person’s monologue, or does that person feel fed by what the other person has to say, and want to add something, respond, or challenge? It’s easier to evaluate yourself as a responder, listener, and contributer, than the other person, I think. So it’s interesting to think about what differentiates a rich conversation from one person telling things to another, and thinking that person is paying attention because he/she is responding at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like there is a huge component of personal awareness, learning to abolish expectations, and as a result, find patience through your passions.\r\n\r\nTime to listen to my own advice, mostly because it’s been a long week, and I haven’t done any work that I’m “supposed” to do\r\n\r\n‘V, stop thinking about it”\r\n\r\n“Ok,” :)', 'Simplify Life by not Thinking about Things: The Value of Social Ignorance', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'simplify-life-by-not-thinking-about-things-the-value-of-social-ignorance', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:15:28', '2010-06-05 22:15:28', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=97', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It isn’t hard for me to acknowledge that I have a lot on my plate - and I like to set up my life in this manner because I think that a certain level of busy-ness (have you ever noticed that you can write that as “business?”) equates to life richness and fullness. I like to feel productive, and needed, and that people appreciate my effort and my energy. However, this setup might be troublesome given that I set high expectations of myself, that I am hard on myself, and this is true to an extreme.\r\n\r\nYou see, I really like to please other people. I might tackle academics, social situations, all of those things with self interest and incentive, but it doesn’t feel good if I feel like I am letting other people down, or I really want people to like me. Thus, I feel like I must excel and be highly impressive in all my academic, social, and personal commitments. it isn’t OK to be average at something, or for someone to not like me, or not be pleased with me. For most of my life, it’s been all or nothing. If I am perfect and meeting the high end of the dimension, great, it feels good. If I am sub-par, it either needs to be fixed or cut out completely. Granted that it takes a HUGE amount of energy to constantly meet high expectations at everything, you might imagine that maintaining this dynamic takes a LOT of energy, probably tires me out, and can lead to emotional distress when I fall short.\r\n\r\nSo let’s think about what is on my plate, at the moment. Vanessa as a… student, an employee, a room-mate, a friend, a sister and daughter, a future grad student, an athlete, and a woman. With all of these roles come ideals, and I create expectations for myself. In my mind, I must excel in class, at my job, in my relationships, with my body, and falling short even the tiniest bit feels like a failure. That’s really bad. Can I learn to be OK with being average at something, and with the idea that some people won’t like me? Is it OK with me that I might not be able to please everyone, at all times, because it feels really liberating to think that I don’t have to live with that burden.\r\nThis comes back to taking responsibility, and feeling like I must be under control. I feel like I must take charge of relationships, and be responsible for doing things so that I appeal to others, so that they like me, no matter what.\r\nIf someone doesn’t like me? I feel like it’s my fault, and I feel awful, and I think of what I might do so that they DO like me… I have to work harder to please them… find out what they want, and be that.\r\nIt’s time to challenge myself. I am going to live my life, and be me, and remove the\r\npersonal responsibility for how other people feel about me. If they don’t like me? I leave it up to them to deal with that. It shouldn’t be my emotional burden to worry if I overwhelm people, or take responsibility for managing how someone feels about me. If I want to see or spend time with someone, I’m going to put energy into that relationship, but not worry about pleasing them. I will do my best at everything that I touch, but if best isn’t pleasing enough to someone else, it is their responsibility to decide how to deal with that. And I will continue to try and evaluate myself more in a currency of energy and learn to value shades of gray. I can’t be perfect, I shouldn’t expect myself to be, I only can expect myself to work hard, be squirmy, and remain humble. In doing these things, I think that I might have better relationships, and find fulfillment in this balance.\r\nIt seems so simple, but it’s going to be a challenge for me, but it’s a beautiful idea, a new perspective, and I’m excited to try looking at the world through it.', 'My use, or overuse, of energy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-use-or-overuse-of-energy', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:16:11', '2010-06-05 22:16:11', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=99', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(101, 1, '2008-05-28 05:17:17', '2008-05-28 09:17:17', 'Life seems to be a lot less about managing time, and resources, and a lot more about managing energy. Responsibilities, and obligations, and passions and social interactions, these things all require energy. There are people that I find drain this valuable resource, and people that fill me right back up. In some interactions, energy comes or goes like a trickle from a stream, and in others it might be taken or gifted in large, potentially overwhelming amounts. Which way is to better to give, and to receive? Which way is more apparent from one person to another? The nerd in me will talk about these two doses of energy in computer game terms, two types of healing spells from Wow, or World of Warcraft. You don’t need to know anything about this game other than the metaphor: healers cast spells with mana to restore other players life, and keep them from crumping. A “Flash of Light” is a quick, tiny heal, and a “Holy Light” is a slower, but more powerful heal. The first is more of an economy heal, it uses a lot less mana, and delivers in much smaller doses. Both are important in the game, and for an interesting metaphor about energy expenditure in life.\r\n\r\nHoly Light I can look back on my life experience, and see times when I have been given energy in large amounts, and I think that this drastic a change can produce a dangerous high, that as soon as the source is removed, leads to a greater fall. So in the examples I am thinking of, it seems that blasting someone with Holy Light for an extended period of time would be exhausting to the giver and the receiver. I think that people have a threshold for receiving energy, just like many things, and the benefits of breaking the threshold are huge, but once you break it, the affects of additional energy are marginal. And the threshold holds for giving as well. So possibly the most fulfilling life experience comes from bouncing back and forth across this threshold, as opposed to remaining constant above and below it. it isn’t the level that is very important, but rather the change in these levels.\r\n\r\nWhen these gifts come as a rare surprise, it can extremely energize and impress the receiver to make the giver feel even better than had he/she tried to maintain in long term. In terms of relationships, if you think about the balance between giving and taking, this is why the tactic of being an endless well of giving isn’t very good for either side. It will ultimately drain you, and potentially push the other person away, either due to being overwhelmed by the giving and feeling guilty about not reciprocating in an equal manner, or adapting to the unmaintainably high level and being disappointed when it drops.\r\n\r\nLike a Holy Light healing spell in WoW, the person receiving gets a lot more in that moment, but it takes a lot more mana, or energy, for the person giving it. In the long run, it hypothetically is a lot harder to maintain this level of giving… it drains the giver of energy. And this is why we have a tiny, efficient way of giving as well.\r\n\r\nFlash of Light: Giving marginally over time, to bounce into positive from negative territory, seems to be an efficient strategy for giver and receiver. The giver isn’t drained of energy, and the receiver is maintained without being overstimulated or overly energized. When I give and receive little amounts of energy from other people during the day, largely without being aware of it, i find these days very positive and fulfilling. Combine a balance of this life energy interaction with the right perspective, and the concept that good and bad days just “happen” and are out of our control is completely eliminated.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to think about how people might react differently to similar amounts of energy. Someone that is used to receiving in large quantities might not get as much out of your act of kindness than someone who is not. People might grow up with different dynamics to expect receiving a certain amount of energy and time from other people, or not expect it. Either extreme seems dangerous… the people that expect it might be constantly disappointed in others, leading to a dynamic of one person exhausting him or herself trying to please the other, or the expectee being given up on by other people because he/she is impossible to please. People that expect not receiving a lot of energy might learn to exist in a hyper-self-sufficient or solitary state, and learn that needing other people could be dangerous, and be overwhelmed when another person invests in them. We like to receive something called self-verification, or feedback that the way we look at ourselves is also the way that other people see us. So one person sending the message to another that “yes, I value you, you are important,” when the second person doesn’t see him or herself as a person that is worthy of or needing value and attention, is going to lead to a turbulent relationship. On the other side of the pancake, a person whose identity is built up around greatness and being constantly pat on the back is going to feel cognitive dissonance when this constant reassurance does not come from another person, is stopped, questioned, or challenged. The bottom line is that if you don’t interact and treat me in the way that supports how I think about myself, that’s really scary.\r\nSo relationships of all types are intricate, and complicated, and too often opaque. Sharing what and more importantly HOW you think, I strongly believe, is the cement that holds us together. If I can try to understand how you look at the world, I might be able to place myself in your shoes, understand your thoughts and behavior more readily, and treat you in the best way I know how, given this insight.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is a lot less important than how I choose to perceive what happens. Understanding myself to know how I might perceive certain interactions and events can let me set up my life in a way that leads me to have interactions, and a schedule doing things for myself and others that has a lot higher probability of turning into a “good” day. Other people rock my world, and I see myself as going from extremes of giving, possibly looking to receive, and then withdrawing when I feel disappointed. So here I am, briefly writing, but mostly thinking about the best ways to connect and relate to others while maintaining my own energy.\r\n\r\nThe answer then, as with many things, isn’t one or the other, black and white. We give huge spurts of energy to people that we care about when levels might be dangerously low, and then more of a trickle over time to maintain our own reserves and continue telling the other person that we care about his or her wellbeing. This post is largely about quantity and quality. An interesting question comes up about distribution - how many people we choose to invest in, and whether that number has an affect on our ability to give trickles or spurts, or potentially spread ourselves too thin, like peanut butter :) But I guess that depends on your preferred ratio of PB to jelly!!!\r\n\r\nand these are hard questions, and in a discussion of energy I find my mind turning into a nice blue goo. And saying that I have an exam in 20 minutes, I better preserve whatever non-goo is left, and then go for a nice, long run and blast my brain with music, because not thinking is just as important.', 'Energy: the currency of life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'energy-the-currency-of-life', '', '', '2010-06-05 18:17:00', '2010-06-05 22:17:00', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=101', 0, 'post', '', 0),

So we like people not based on the favors they do for us, but what we do for them.\r\n\r\nI think it is key that external justification, so a reason outside myself that I am doing said action, is subtle. A good example is doing a favor for something “just being nice” versus being told or paid to do something. The person who is just being nice is going to like the receiver of the favor much more.\r\n\r\nSo in a successful relationship (of whatever type) it makes sense, then, that this give and take must be balanced. Person A might be constantly getting a high off of doing things for Person B (under the potentially false guise that doing these things is making Person B like person A more) but I would say that there is either minimal increases in how person B feels for A, or person B might not be doing favors for A, and either will feel insufficient or guilty about receiving from A, and the relationship goes off balance. Person B might learn to expect these favors from A, and take things for granted.\r\nSo what does this mean for good relationships? It means that one sided relationships only feed one person, and might even have negative consequences for the other. Both parties, to make themselves feel good, should do things for the other. The hard part is finding relationships in life, whether they be friendships, coworkers, or lovers, for which it is contextually appropriate to do favors for the other person that actually are things that you enjoy.\r\n\r\nI can try to think of examples. This first one is overly simple. Think of two friends that meet up to play tennis together. Each gets a lot of joy out of playing tennis, and in context of doing it for one another, both might like each other more than before, and rate each other as being closer friends.\r\nIn high school I used to bake cakes for all my friends on their birthdays. It was a “favor” in the definition of the word, had little external motivation, but I loved baking by itself, and giving my beautiful creations to others made me feel good. The fact that I had these friends for which to do this baking, something that I love, made me like them more.\r\n\r\nSo maybe it isn’t such a bad idea to ask people for favors to strengthen a relationship, or find out if it can be strengthened in that regard. From an opposite standpoint, if I ask someone for a favor and they turn me down, the exact opposite occurs. I guess it’s all about balance, again, and this second idea is probably why I don’t like to ask people for favors, ever. But in not asking, I don’t let people do nice things for me, and feel everything that comes with that.\r\n\r\nAnd a beautiful idea that was said by one of my professors is the statement that “love is not always a feeling, it’s an action verb.” If you do acts of love, give affection, even when you don’t feel it, it will get you over those humps in a relationship when the feeling isn’t there. I would say that friendship is an action verb as well, and this is exactly the reason that having deep, true friendships is a rarity - it takes a lot of energy, and it’s a lot easier to expend less energy and remain on a superficial level.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I know that I put a lot of energy into friendships from high school after I went to college, and I’m very lucky to still have my best friend. However, for the so many that I lost, I learned that my expenditure was largely a waste. As a result, I don’t spend very much energy on other people anymore, unless I get some indication that the interaction might become balanced and two way.

And I can admit to starting on paths of friendship here, and either feeling overwhelmed by being the sole provider of energy, or just not enjoying the favors that I do enough for the other person to keep it going. I might start on a track of doing favors for the other person until it feels like some sort of expectation, and then I don’t enjoy the friendship like I used to. So I’ll just stop, and keep waiting for people to enter the picture that show an interest in knowing and understanding me, and also that I find fulfillment in doing things for.

So I want to talk about one more idea, Kelly’s idea of “constructs.” Constructs are interpretations that we have about the world that help us to predict behavior. Kelly uses 11 corollaries to help explain this idea child. If you want less of the theory and more of my ideas and evaluation, skip down to “Sociality,” that’s where it gets interesting, but understanding the theory is important too!\r\n\r\n<strong>Construction:</strong> I can anticipate events by construing their replications (my friend is often late, so probably will be for this instance too!) This anticipation is not possible without replication.\r\n\r\n<strong>Individuality:</strong> people just differ in construction of events, it’s what makes everyone different.\r\n\r\n<strong>Organization:</strong> the construction system is built around relationships between constructs\r\n<strong>\r\nDichotomy:</strong> Our construction system is based upon a finite number of dichotomous constructs. We look at people and situations and characterize them, but there has to be a spectrum, I can’t understand something if I don’t understand it’s opposite. I can’t understand good without having a knowledge of bad, safety doesn’t make sense without it’s opposite danger, etc …and going off of this idea, I would say that most people take the safe route and just stick with the constructs they already have, which I guess you might call being narrow minded or unable to be empathetic, but it makes them less likely, i would speculate, to be able to connect with other people that have different constructs (look at the world in a different way) And then I would also say that people who have an idea of a concept but DON’T understand the level of the opposite either 1. take the idea and applications of it for granted (good health, a good friend) or 2. become stuck in a one minded perception in that when the opposite DOES come along they might negate its value (oh, that’s not very important) or just apply the dominance of their end of the spectrum and make value statements (well, that person just needs to be happy , why wouldn’t he?\r\n\r\n<strong>Choice: </strong>I can be safe and look at something with my established construct system, or take a chance and try to apply a new construct, the choice corollary is trying to look at the world in a different way. It’s a risk, of course, but I think that people who take the risk have a more developed, complex system of constructs than those who opt for the safe route.\r\n\r\n<strong>Range:</strong> every construct has an appropriate range it can be applied to. Every construct doesn’t apply in every situation\r\n\r\n<strong>Experience:</strong> corollary says that my construct system varies as I successfully/unsuccessfully construe the replication of events.\r\n\r\n<strong>Modulation:</strong> some constructs are more plastic/malleable/changeable than others.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fragmentation</strong> corollary says that because these constructs are in constant change, there is the possibility for inconsistent behavior\r\n\r\n<strong>Commonality: </strong>similar construct systems = similar personalities (the idea that “wow, we see the world in such a similar way!! I feel you!!”)\r\n\r\n<strong>Sociality:</strong> (the most interesting, in my opinion) to the extent that one person can construe the construction process of another person, he may play a role in social processes involving the other person. So I have to understand someone else’s construction in order to have an interaction with them, and the role I play is dependent on how I understand the other person to perceive me, or how the other person construes my role should be. (Man, this just feels so real, that people, (that I) act, based on how I think others expect or want me to, and me being able to do that requires that I understand the person on a non-superficial level. And of course this isn’t all or nothing, I can see sharing some constructs with another person and enough so that personalities are similar, but not all.\r\n\r\nFor example, in my daily speculation I was thinking about the idea of affection, on an emotional and a physical level, and I realize that I’m pretty one sided. I don’t have an understanding of emotionally caring for someone else, not to say that I am incapable of it, but it’s in its infancy. My way of showing emotional support is to make you feel good with buying you things, baking you cakes, giving you cards, and sharing things like quotes, music, and ideas that have made me feel better when I am down, but I have a hard time willingly putting myself in the emotional shoes of another person, and trying to actually live his or her experience to understand it.\r\n\r\n<strong>But why Vanessa, why?!?</strong> Well I can easily say that in my family, there is a lot of physical affection: hugs, doing nice things for each other that might make them feel better, but there isn’t a lot of venturing into the “I felt this way when you did this… do you understand?” That and I’m the youngest, which has always placed me at the receiving end of all types of affection, and less so at the giving end. So that has made me weaker on the emotional affection side, and leaning heavily on valuing physical affection. It’s not that I don’t understand it or feel it, but that I don’t know how to express it or deal with it in relation to other people.\r\n\r\nHere’s the frustration, I can’t express the best way I know how to give affection, physically, with most people outside of family and the rare occurrence of a boyfriend. It’s sort of a contradiction, and I can see how being unable to make a friend or someone I care about feel better might make me distant, or even worse, just seeming like I don’t care. It isn’t socially acceptable, outside of an intimate physical relationship, to express affection through kisses, or touch, or hugging and gazing into eyes and hoping for the life of me that the emotions that I feel and want to express and share somehow are transferred physically. I’m not saying that I WANT to express physical affection towards everyone, I don’t, but I sure as heck need to work on expressing emotional affection a lot more than I do, because no, bonking heads with someone does not imbue them with the strong things I feel and want to share, and sending a card or baking a cake can only go so far. I’m limited to being able to listen to someone, share things that have made me feel better, and give relentlessly, and hope that said person feels better.\r\n\r\n<strong>The implications of this?</strong> I’ll have no problem expressing physical affection in a relationship, but I’ll have trouble with friendships.

(116, 1, '2010-06-07 07:49:20', '2010-06-07 11:49:20', 'This is the way that it usually works, when I want to express what I’m thinking… when it rains, it pours! So I want to talk about one more idea, Kelly’s idea of “constructs.” Constructs are interpretations that we have about the world that help us to predict behavior. Kelly uses 11 corollaries to help explain this idea child. If you want less of the theory and more of my ideas and evaluation, skip down to “Sociality,” that’s where it gets interesting, but understanding the theory is important too!\n\n<strong>Construction:</strong> I can anticipate events by construing their replications (my friend is often late, so probably will be for this instance too!) This anticipation is not possible without replication.\n\n<strong>Individuality:</strong> people just differ in construction of events, it’s what makes everyone different.\n\n<strong>Organization:</strong> the construction system is built around relationships between constructs\n<strong>\nDichotomy:</strong> Our construction system is based upon a finite number of dichotomous constructs. We look at people and situations and characterize them, but there has to be a spectrum, I can’t understand something if I don’t understand it’s opposite. I can’t understand good without having a knowledge of bad, safety doesn’t make sense without it’s opposite danger, etc …and going off of this idea, I would say that most people take the safe route and just stick with the constructs they already have, which I guess you might call being narrow minded or unable to be empathetic, but it makes them less likely, i would speculate, to be able to connect with other people that have different constructs (look at the world in a different way) And then I would also say that people who have an idea of a concept but DON’T understand the level of the opposite either 1. take the idea and applications of it for granted (good health, a good friend) or 2. become stuck in a one minded perception in that when the opposite DOES come along they might negate its value (oh, that’s not very important) or just apply the dominance of their end of the spectrum and make value statements (well, that person just needs to be happy , why wouldn’t he?\n\n<strong>Choice: </strong>I can be safe and look at something with my established construct system, or take a chance and try to apply a new construct, the choice corollary is trying to look at the world in a different way. It’s a risk, of course, but I think that people who take the risk have a more developed, complex system of constructs than those who opt for the safe route.\n\n<strong>Range:</strong> every construct has an appropriate range it can be applied to. Every construct doesn’t apply in every situation\n\n<strong>Experience:</strong> corollary says that my construct system varies as I successfully/unsuccessfully construe the replication of events.\n\n<strong>Modulation:</strong> some constructs are more plastic/malleable/changeable than others.\n\n<strong>Fragmentation</strong> corollary says that because these constructs are in constant change, there is the possibility for inconsistent behavior\n\n<strong>Commonality: </strong>similar construct systems = similar personalities (the idea that “wow, we see the world in such a similar way!! I feel you!!”)\n\nSociality: (the most interesting, in my opinion) to the extent that one person can construe the construction process of another person, he may play a role in social processes involving the other person. So I have to understand someone else’s construction in order to have an interaction with them, and the role I play is dependent on how I understand the other person to perceive me, or how the other person construes my role should be. (Man, this just feels so real, that people, (that I) act, based on how I think others expect or want me to, and me being able to do that requires that I understand the person on a non-superficial level. And of course this isn’t all or nothing, I can see sharing some constructs with another person and enough so that personalities are similar, but not all.\n\nFor example, in my daily speculation I was thinking about the idea of affection, on an emotional and a physical level, and I realize that I’m pretty one sided. I don’t have an understanding of emotionally caring for someone else, not to say that I am incapable of it, but it’s in its infancy. My way of showing emotional support is to make you feel good with buying you things, baking you cakes, giving you cards, and sharing things like quotes, music, and ideas that have made me feel better when I am down, but I have a hard time willingly putting myself in the emotional shoes of another person, and trying to actually live his or her experience to understand it.\n\nBut why Vanessa, why?!? Well I can easily say that in my family, there is a lot of physical affection: hugs, doing nice things for each other that might make them feel better, but there isn’t a lot of venturing into the “I felt this way when you did this… do you understand?” That and I’m the youngest, which has always placed me at the receiving end of all types of affection, and less so at the giving end. So that has made me weaker on the emotional affection side, and leaning heavily on valuing physical affection. It’s not that I don’t understand it or feel it, but that I don’t know how to express it or deal with it in relation to other people.\n\nHere’s the frustration, I can’t express the best way I know how to give affection, physically, with most people outside of family and the rare occurrence of a boyfriend. It’s sort of a contradiction, and I can see how being unable to make a friend or someone I care about feel better might make me distant, or even worse, just seeming like I don’t care. It isn’t socially acceptable, outside of an intimate physical relationship, to express affection through kisses, or touch, or hugging and gazing into eyes and hoping for the life of me that the emotions that I feel and want to express and share somehow are transferred physically. I’m not saying that I WANT to express physical affection towards everyone, I don’t, but I sure as heck need to work on expressing emotional affection a lot more than I do, because no, bonking heads with someone does not imbue them with the strong things I feel and want to share, and sending a card or baking a cake can only go so far. I’m limited to being able to listen to someone, share things that have made me feel better, and give relentlessly, and hope that said person feels better.\n\nThe implications of this? I’ll have no problem expressing physical affection in a relationship, but I’ll have trouble with friendships. And then when you think about the construct system, that people who have similar constructs have similar personalities and therefore “understand” one another (which arguably leads to a good friendship, no?) and this last social corollary, that we act based on what we perceive others to expect of us, well when I am in need of affection, I’m pretty sure that my friends won’t know how to give it to me, and that sucks on their side.

Extroverts have crickets chirping up there, so they seek out stimulation to meet the baseline level.\r\n\r\nThis might be why introverts are comfortable and can even fall asleep in absence of sensory stimulation, and extroverts go insane.

(119, 1, '2008-02-16 20:55:30', '2008-02-17 00:55:30', 'I’ve been thinking about Rogers phenomenological viewpoint and the idea of actual versus ideal self, and of course have some thoughts.\r\n\r\nI have an appreciation for the phenomenological viewpoint because it imbues the individual with free will and states that human beings are all inherently good and striving towards their actual selves, or full potential. The hairy beastie that comes into the equation is the environment, but as humans we are still in control of our reactions to that environment. In stating this I start to think of neurobiology and correlating neurotransmitters and electrical firing to behavior and personality, suggesting that we are less ghost and more machine, but for the sake of the phenomenological viewpoint I will stick to the beautiful idea of free will.\r\n\r\nCarl Rogers came up with this phenomenological viewpoint, and in it he also discusses a subconscious guide called the “organismic valuing process,” or a tendency to draw us towards experience that allow us to grow, and away from experiences and people that inhibit growth. This sounds like gut feeling to me, and I think that in a society that idealizes certain qualities and experiences that may be true to some and not others, there is a higher risk of forcing oneself into experiences that go against gut feeling, and consequently inhibit growth. The voice of what is socially acceptable and prized seems to be stronger than the intuitive, inner voice that guides the individual towards self realization.\r\n\r\nI agree with Rogers that our perceptions of our selves are most important in leading to self actualizing and happiness, but I wonder about whether it is my perception of myself that is most important, or how I perceive others to perceive me. I say this because there are aspects of myself for which the ideal self and actual self are correlated, but I might think that other people look down on this characteristic, despite me valuing it. I think that Rogers theory probably takes this sort of social influence into account in the idea that the ideal self is influenced by society, but I question whether the Q-sort can correctly account for stubbornness on the individual’s part in having a trait that they perceive as valuable and matching up with their ideal self, but feeling judged in the eyes of society. I think there should be three measures taken for assessment: a measure of ideal self, a measure of actual self, and a measure of what the individual thinks that people perceive them to be. I might guess that people who differ widely between how they actually are and how they think they are perceived might be more psychologically troubled because they are either working hard to maintain a false image or are unable to relate their true selves to others, or feel that their true self is not appreciated by others. For example, I see myself as highly ethical, and value that characteristic, but I know that many behaviors that I don’t engage in as a result of this quality are not judged highly by my peer group. It might not even be that they judge it poorly, but that their behavior reflects a large difference between our expressions of that characteristic, which makes me question it. Even if many might value this characteristic, what matters is my observation of my peers’ behavior, my judgment of their level of this characteristic, and then the conclusion that the large difference means that I must be judged poorly by them. In a sense, this is jumping to concussions, but I feel very strongly that the idea that we look at ourselves through the eyes of other people should be further explored. A society that verbally promotes individuality but leads to and an unspoken lemming dynamic can certainly play tricks on the individual’s psychological health.\r\n\r\nIt might be beneficial to ask how humans developed this dynamic from a phenomenological viewpoint. All organisms have a need to be appreciated, loved, and valued, first from others, and then from themselves. If an individual perceives having a quality about himself or herself as a bad thing, that he or she might only be valued in absence of a certain quality or in the presence of one that is lacked, then this might lead to a conditioned sense of positive regard. Put in simpler terms, I am told that being valued by society is dependent on having factors x and y and not z, and consequently I am alienated from my true self and/or learn to not trust my feelings. Either way, these conditions of worth make one move away from his or her true self, and in the presence of expectation and internal (possibly unconscious feelings of lacking or defiance), anxiety is born. This anxiety seems to be what differentiates a fully functioning person that is in touch with his or her true self from a maladjusted person. The maladjusted person is either driven to conformity despite straying from their actual selves, which I would argue is the type of person that makes up the majority of society, or caught between a rock and a hard place, unable to meet the conditions of worth, anxious and seeking positive regard, but still trusting gut feelings and unable or unwilling to conform. It is only those individuals whose qualities match up with the expectations of society who never perceive conditions of worth and are allowed to pursue their ideal selves with full support. For everyone else, finding coping strategies to deal with this anxiety while maintaining outward composure is the challenge of being human.', 'You are only as strong as I perceive you to be', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'you-are-only-as-strong-as-i-perceive-you-to-be', '', '', '2010-06-07 07:52:09', '2010-06-07 11:52:09', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=119', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The mind contains and directs its limited supply of energetic forces, and energy spent on one task leaves less energy for everything else. That’s why after taking an exam, I am exhausted. And, of course, this limited well makes multitasking very challenging. I am a strong believer in science and having hard evidence to prove a theory, but I also believe that there are some phenomena related to our perception that we have yet to understand, or even measure. I think that our perception of ”reality” is just that, a perception, completely fabricated in the mind in response to a mixture of stimuli and forces that we might not be able to see and really don’t understand. Think about the blind spot in your vision due to the optic nerve exiting the back of the eye. There are no rods and cones there, yet your brain weaves the hole closed so you are not aware of it. Similarly, we adapt to the shadows cast by the intricate web of veins on the inside of our eyelids. Think of something like blind-sight, or the idea that damage to the part of the brain responsible for seeing can render someone blind, but they are still able to reach for and perceive objects in a mysterious way. Think about how texture, color, depth, spatial aspects, and vision are controlled by different parts of the brain, but some inner monkey puts it all together, and tricks us that we have one vision, solitary in our perception.\r\n\r\nBut back to this energy. It can be focused, released, or blocked, and if you block it, it will simply find release through the path of least resistance. And we find pleasure in the release of this energy, because it is a release of tension. So let’s say you feel some sort of anxiety and fail to deal with it in a healthy way… it might release as an even uglier beast in the long run or even something called hysteria, which is an emotional sympton expressed as a physical condition. I would postulate this is a starting point for hypochondriacs. I think that these inner demons can build up unconsciously and traumatize an individual without he or she being aware of the original cause. On the other hand, this energy might build up and expressed in another way, perhaps through cultural productivity, but I think that being productive to deal with suppressed anxiety does not relinquish it, but only holds it at bay.', 'The Mind as Energy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-mind-as-energy', '', '', '2010-06-07 07:52:53', '2010-06-07 11:52:53', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=121', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The novel is obviously modeled after Duke and some other private, large universities and portrays guys as status seeking, frat-culted, sexual predators and girls as attention and approval seeking sex and image slaves, so completely absorbed with the idea of "effortless perfection." And there is a lot of truth to this superficiality, the hookup culture, and lemming-likeness of our generation... but what made this novel so tragic is that in the end the main character, Charlotte, so bright and intelligent and different, wound up giving in, and I''m not even sure she was aware of it. I''ve always held on to some hope that below this stereotypical blanket that defines many universities and our generation in general, you can still find real people, gems amongst the rocks, who are proud of their identities, don''t put up facades, mask their emotions, cave in to peer pressure or what is "cool" sort of "what you see is what you get."

The peer review process that Beth Noveck proposes based on the large scale collaboration of experts is intriguing, but I wonder about incentives behind this system. What would give a large number of experts in the public incentive to contribute to this review process in a short period of three months, especially when the ultimate power of decision lies in the hands of the middleman at the patent office? Online, open source systems are very powerful, but I question how much a system controlled by a central power can flourish and grow. It is apparent from the falling salaries that Noveck mentions that patent office employees are not valued. Based on this fact, I do not think that it is probable that this job will exist in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo successfully implement this “collective intelligence,” we must get rid of the middlemen, give public experts complete power to dictate patents, and then deal with the court system electronically. This would call for a complete revamping of the entire patent system, which is why it is so unlikely to happen. The barrier to a better system is the fact that humans are very resistant to change, which Noveck alludes to when she says, “I don’t want to do anything too revolutionary. I want this thing to happen.” Complacency as is seen in this situation is very dangerous because it prevents the change of a corrupt system. I think it is ridiculous that money-hungry oil companies have the power to hold patents for solar technology so it cannot benefit society. I am also very skeptical about pharmaceutical companies’ incentives for creating drugs, and do not agree with Noveck that the patent process provides incentive for national competition.\r\n\r\nNoveck refers to companies with high startup and research costs as the biggest participants in national competition. These criteria bring pharmaceutical companies to mind, which I consider to be the most money hungry, monopolistic monsters in the corporate world. United States’ drug companies dominate the global drug industry, as the best selling drugs in the world are primarily created by U.S. companies. These companies take more money from sales as profit than they spend on research and development. Drug companies are not aiming for innovation. They are creating slightly modified versions of drugs already on the market to make a quick profit or to extend patents, which is an abuse of the system. I don’t think that a large, collective intelligence would allow pharmaceutical companies to do this, so they would have to engage in more innovative research to come out with better drugs to get a patent and make their profits.Change is needed, and it will come slowly. I am hopeful that advocates like Beth Noveck will influence small changes that will accumulate over time, and eventually lead to a large transformation of the patent system.', 'Crust-less PB&J Should Not Be Patented', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'crust-less-pbj-should-not-be-patented', '', '', '2010-06-07 08:27:39', '2010-06-07 12:27:39', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=154', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(156, 1, '2007-05-11 15:34:11', '2007-05-11 19:34:11', 'Philadelphia is going wireless. The present issues concerning the implementation of a city wide wireless system are debatable. However, they wane in comparison to the larger implications of a “Wireless Philadelphia,” which are both curious and frightening.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that this project fundamentally is an effort for the government to exert control. EarthLink, the ISP of choice because of its liberal views, will have a monopoly over Philadelphia, as Google will have over San Francisco (K.Rogerson). As Ken Rogerson pointed out, the network will be “maintained” by a non profit agency, also known as the government. This liaison brings up issues of privacy. It seems to me that one of the main incentives for the government to subsidize this project is a long term promise of information, as in the long run the internet will continue encompassing a larger part of our financial, personal, and communicative lives. This cause seemingly geared towards education and betterment of the community is actually an effort to put a leash on a universe that supports direct democracy over represented democracy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a city completely controlled by one ISP would allow this ISP to control the internet space of consumers, possibly leading to a more “geographically bordered” web experience, as Michael Geist alluded to in his article. Could this control be used to unify Philadelphia as community? I think it might allow for specified advertising and stricter access rules, but I do not see a common ISP as uniting a community, as the internet historically has broken the boundaries of location.\r\n\r\nNow I would like to discuss the scary part of having a government controlled city-wide network. The first part isn’t so scary. This sort of system might easily transition into connecting a citizen to his or her school, the grocery store, the postal system, and other services of the town. A citizen may be registered on the wireless network as being a member of the town, and could apply this registration with the swipe of a card, such as driver’s license. With wireless across the city and possibly the nation, the nonprofit (government) might be able to monitor every citizen’s transaction, movement, and personal information. As this becomes more popular, perhaps having this valuable information on a card won’t be safe. The next suggestion will be to use retinal or fingerprinting technology, or just have an implanted chip. The government might utilize our fear against terrorism to convince us that as true American citizens we should have this done, so we can pick out “the other guys.” Parents might be told that with this technology they can keep track of their kids, or maybe completely eliminate the burden of paper money. Our every action might be under the quiet surveillance of the government, to be used for behavioral or spending analysis. Anyone that breaks any law in any way or has any information to hide now becomes revealed and easily locatable. Privacy is non existent. We might ultimately become prisoners without bars.\r\nI don’t want to live in a world like that.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that other ISP’s will lose some business due to this move. What are the implications of this? I think that other ISP’s are going to make private deals with businesses such as hotels and cafes and schools that would benefit from wireless. We will probably see Earthlink’s wireless blocked in some domains. Other ISP’s will be forced to provide either better wireless for a competitive price, or equal wireless for a lower price. This healthy competition would benefit Philadelphia businesses as they would save money, but how does this benefit the citizens? It is doubtful that the workers of these businesses will see any of the returns from this deal. Therefore, the long run implications are to benefit stockholders and not citizens.\r\n\r\nI am curious about the distinction between communication via a cell phone and online communication technology, such as iphone that offers voice over IP (iphone.com). I think the two might become one and the same. The internet will control all aspects of our daily lives and absorb the phone and telephone industry, and possibly areas of government, such as with the patent office, which we discussed last week.\r\n\r\ni do worry about EarthLink having total control, and I wonder about true incentives behind this move. Clearly EarthLink is being supported by the government, and it is worrisome that once they have this control they will assert their power.\r\n\r\nI wonder how much a universal wireless network can benefit a city like Philadelphia. Through starbucks.com I discovered that there are seventeen Starbucks Coffee shops with wireless in downtown Philadelphia alone. I know that many hotels and common social spots offer wireless as well. The point is that Philadelphia is already very wireless. In a big city like Philadelphia I maintain my view that the money used for this project could be better spent on the school systems. It seems to me that having internet access is useless if individuals do not have computers or a good education.', 'A wireless city?

Howard Dean, a presidential candidate for the 2004 election, was the first to directly connect his campaign to the internet via his “Blog For America” and campaigning website, www.deanforamerica.com. I think that the internet will be a widely used campaign tool and resource in American politics, and it might fundamentally change how Americans relate to the democratic process.The internet will decrease the cost of campaigning and therefore allow more qualified people to run. Ken Rogerson commented that Howard Dean didn’t think he would go very far in the race in 2000 because he didn’t have the money. However, many small donations, thanks to his website, proved him wrong. Currently, it seems to me that running for President requires a higher financial status. With the ability to draw people in, collect donations, and generally spend less doing so, the internet will allow for individuals with less financial means to run. In 2004, the Kerry and Bush campaigns spent $1 on web campaigning for every $100 they spent on TV campaigning (Pew Internet and American Life Project). And clearly, web campaigning reaches the people, as 75 million individuals used the internet to get political news, email candidates, and participate in the political process in 2004. Additionally, 52% of these people said that the information they found online directly influenced their vote. (The Pew Research Center and University of Minnesota). This transition is a positive one for the entire political sector because it opens up the door for qualified yet not incredibly rich individuals to campaign.\r\nThe internet is the first mode of political communication in which American citizens can speak back. When I heard about citizens communicating via blogs and online communities my first question was, is anyone listening on the other side? Who is the modulator of this space? I disagree that not having threads prevents any “comparison.” If people can read each other’s opinions then comparisons will be done. If an individual contributes an opinion and does not receive support, then this individual may be disinclined to do it again. I also wonder if the act of posting an opinion actually improves the democratic process, or merely makes people feel more involved? Do the people participating in this discussion represent society by any degree? These questions relate back to the “Digital Divide,” and a question that Weinberger addresses in his interview. Weinberger admitted that an open source community attracts people who want to be a part of this social community, and these people are not necessary united by a desire to have a particular candidate for president. Additionally, people that cannot access the internet have no power to participate in this open source project, but this topic was last week’s discussion.\r\nAnother question that I asked was: who will be angry about this transition? Thanks to the internet, ideas and news aren’t very scarce anymore. In the past, the media had a lot of power in presenting political candidates to the public. However now, the once elevated status of journalist or writer is sinking into a sea of ordinary people. Over 75,000 new blogs are created every day (Pew Internet Research). I think that the media is definitely losing power, but they can still be very influential. In my opinion, Howard Dean lost the presidential election due to a malicious move by the media to over exaggerate an expression of his enthusiasm.\r\nI think that online political campaigning is in infancy and will be utilized heavily in the next Presidential election. I can see the internet connecting people directly to a candidate or cause via video feeds, online discussion and voting, petition signing, interviewing, advertising, and even parodies like at jibjab.com. This online democracy works well with the idea of a “wireless Philadelphia,” as a secure wireless system could identify citizens safely and allow for online voting, leading to more of a direct democracy with a higher participation rate (slate.com). However, presidential candidates may be inclined to form their opinions based on popular opinion from their site, rendering our President nothing more than a pretty face.\r\nWhen it comes down to it, interacting with real people is more valuable than interacting with a computer. However, if the internet can bring people together in the real world and influence people to participate in the democratic process, then it is valuable as well.', 'Running a Nation: Only a Click Away', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'running-a-nation-only-a-click-away', '', '', '2010-06-07 08:29:31', '2010-06-07 12:29:31', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=158', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(160, 1, '2007-05-11 15:07:38', '2007-05-11 19:07:38', 'Brewster Kahle’s proposition to make all human knowledge available online might be a lofty goal, but as he points out, it is fiscally possible. I think the most interesting implications of this possibility have to do with the way in which people consume information. I think that a public, free database of all human knowledge might change society by creating a quality gradient on the internet and creating a market for digital books.\r\nDigital books might become prevalent on college campuses. Let’s image that every single publication is available online, for free. To start off with, I do not think that people like to read things on the computer screen. This taste might lead to the innovation of a “digital book,” or a portable electronic device that is shaped like a book with digital pages to simulate the experience of curling up with a book. Thanks to “Lumalive” textiles by Phillips, LED technology has been incorporated into fabrics. Although this technology is currently being marketed toward consumer apparels like clothing and furniture, I think the next step might be toward more practical uses. An electronic book would be a great product for students because it would eliminate the physical burden of carrying books. I can imagine a lightweight digital book filled with all of a student’s reading materials that allows the student to highlight sections of text and proceeds to organize these sections in a notes document for studying purposes. Perhaps these notes might be shared online by students as well, and readings from professors downloaded from Blackboard. I can see how libraries may embrace this technology and transform into places incorporating these electronic books.On the other hand, I think this movement to make all human knowledge available online could also render libraries useless. If I can download any and all information that I need from online, and as Kahle says, print a book for only one dollar, why should I go to the library? According to the Digital Library Federation, which has combined digital libraries from universities across the United States, use of print resources, academic reserves, and overall library circulation is declining. At many academic institutions, 75% of students access library resources via the internet without ever going to the library. It is simply easier to use the internet. As Paolo Mangiafico noted, libraries need to be geared more towards connecting people over simply holding information, or they will be rendered useless.\r\n\r\nA digital library might create a quality gradient across information on the internet. A published piece of work is more respectable and “legitimate” than a blog or a random website spouting facts. I am thinking of educational resources, however, Kahle proposed to have all human knowledge available online. Do we want all of human knowledge to be available online? Searching through every book, TV show, journal article, and podcast to find one nugget of information might be overwhelming, especially since the net is already encumbered. Currently, the average search engine only crawls across 10% of everything out there, called the “surface web,” leaving the other 90% unsearchable (searchenginewatch.com). This is a problem if students are using search engines as primary sources for information, and they are according to the Digital Library Federation. Of this “surface web,” only 7% of searchable information is appropriate for educational use. Perhaps with a digital library, students might actually find quality information in their internet searches. The key to the success of this initiative is finding the best way to organize and search this information. When this is done, people might find information faster and consume more of it. As James Surowieki noted, exposure to a broad span of information is important to prevent information cascade. If this method of searching for books does not involve the use of what we currently call a search engine, the Googles and Yahoos of the world might incorporate digital library searching into their pages, and further segregate information on the internet.\r\n\r\nAs a representative college student who strives for efficiency and thoroughness at the same time, having high quality “legitimately published” information at my fingertips is very valuable. Creating a quality gradient of information might make learning more accessible, and finally give the internet some well needed respect.', 'Knowledge in the Palm of Your Hand', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'knowledge-in-the-palm-of-your-hand', '', '', '2010-06-07 08:30:04', '2010-06-07 12:30:04', '', 0, 'http://www.vsoch.com/?p=160', 0, 'post', '', 0),
