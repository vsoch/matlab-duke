1. We are asking permission to send a short questionnaire to someone nominated by you who knows you well. We would like the names of three people who know you well to get a more rounded view of you. These people could be a partner, a sibling, a friend, a parent, an employer, or anyone who you think knows you well. We will send them a questionnaire along with a letter that briefly explains the history of the Duke Neurogenetics Study."
