Directions: Please respond by selecting yes or no, as to whether you experienced any of the following events over the PAST YEAR . If you did experience the event, indicate how many times it occurred and the approximate date (dd/mm/yy).  If an event occurred, please select YES. Then indicate the degree to which adapting to the event required you to change core aspects of your life plans and/or your self-view. This rating is referred to as an impact rating and will be rated on the 4-point scale below.  In contrast, if an event caused you to significantly change your life plans and/or how you think or feel about yourself, and this change lasted for at least a week, it would be given a severe impact rating (#4 on scale below). For instance, if an event occurred and had an effect on you that lasted for about 1-2 days, but it did not alter your life plans much and/or how you view yourself, it would be given a "minor" impact rating (#1 on scale below).
